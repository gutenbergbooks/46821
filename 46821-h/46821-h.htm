<p class="pch">THE CORONATION</p>


<p>And so the great Act draws near&mdash;the "high
midsummer pomp" of Patriotism and Regality
and Religion&mdash;the "one far-off divine event" to
which the whole social creation has moved since
the day was appointed and the preparations
began. A thousand pens will picture the Coronation
as it actually occurs. Writing in advance,
I can only contemplate it as a magnificent ideal,
and describe it as it strikes not the eye and ear
but the heart, the imagination, and the historic
sense.</p>

<p>First and foremost and above all else, the Coronation
is a religious act. It is imbedded in the
very heart of the great Christian service of the
Holy Eucharist. Litany and Introit and Gospel
and Creed lead up to it, and it in turn leads on
to <i>Te Deum</i> and Offertory and Consecration and
Communion. But though (or perhaps because)
it is thus supremely and conspicuously religious,
the Coronation is national and secular and historical
as well. Other nations do not crown their
Sovereigns. Some have no crowns to give, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
others are in doubt about the rightful recipients;
in some, revolutions have shattered the immemorial
landmarks, or the sharp sword of civil war
has severed the sacred thread of succession, or the
State itself is a mushroom growth of yesterday,
with no roots and fibres striking deep down to
the bedrock of the national life.</p>

<p>But here in England we crown our kings as
we have crowned them for a thousand years, and
our act of crowning is the august symbol of a
nation's story and a people's will. For before ever
the ministers of God approach the altar, before
the sacred emblems of sovereignty are hallowed,
before the Christian's Mysteries begin, before the
Eternal Spirit is invoked and the consecrating
unction bestowed, the English people plays its
part, and, through the mouth of its chief citizen
asserts its fundamental place in the system of the
Kingly Commonwealth.</p>

<p>"Sirs, I here present unto you King Edward,
the undoubted King of this realm; wherefore all
you who are come this day to do your homage,
are you willing to do the same?" And, as the
King stands up and turns and shows himself four
times to the assembled freemen, they "signify their
willingness and joy by loud and repeated acclamations,
all with one voice crying out, 'God Save
King Edward.'"</p>

<p>And here I borrow from one<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who touches as no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
other living man can touch these dramatic solemnities
of our national life (for I know he will
consent to the borrowing), and I say that this is
as noble as it is intelligible. "It embodies the
splendid liberty with which a free people asserts its
claim to have nothing imposed upon it in the dark,
no tyrannous rule set over it which it has not
measured and considered and acknowledged in the
open light of Heaven." And then the whole great
company falls to prayer, and the Archbishop, who
has hitherto played his part as the first citizen of
England and the greatest subject of the Crown,
takes up a still higher function, and goes up, vested
to the altar and begins the Service of the Eucharist,
and, as a priest, invokes the supreme sanction of
the Eternal. And then the majestic course of the
rite is broken off in the very centre, and, with
every act and feature and ceremony which can
most forcibly express the solemnity of the transaction,
the Archbishop demands of the King, in
the face of God and the Church and the people,
whether he will promise to rule England in due
obedience to law and with sacred regard to Justice,
Mercy, and Religion. And the King gives his
promise, and, kneeling at the altar, confirms it
with an oath upon the Holy Gospel.</p>

<p>"This free intercourse that passes between Ruler
and Ruled is no child's play, no mere pretty ceremonial;
it is the act of men in solemn earnest
pledging their troth the one to the other. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
act is broad and deep and strong as the national
life. It embodies the experience of centuries. It
has in it the stern breath of conflict and the
anxious determinations of secured peace. The
Great Charter is behind it, and the memories of
Runnymede and Whitehall. It seals a concentrated
purpose. King and people look each other
in the face, and speak their minds out and give
their word." And then, and not till then, the
Archbishop will go forward with his hallowing
office and perform the symbolic acts, and pronounce
the benediction of the Highest upon the
covenant between King and Commonwealth. He
anoints with the sacred unction and girds with the
kingly sword. He delivers the sceptre of empire
and the emblematic orb which, "set under the
Cross," reminds the King "that the whole world
is subject to the power and empire of Christ our
Redeemer." And then the crown, of pure gold
enriched with gems each one of which is a history,
is set upon the Sovereign's head, and the Archbishop
blesses and the onlookers acclaim.</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Blow, trumpets; all your exultations blow!"</p>

<p class="p1">as King Edward VII. takes his seat on the throne
of the Confessor and the Conqueror, of the Plantagenets
and the Tudors, and receives by the mouth
of all that is greatest in Church and State the proud
homage of a self-governing people.</p>

<p>And then, once again, the splendid trappings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sovereignty are laid aside, and the King, uncrowned,
kneels down like the lowliest son of
Adam before the Mercy-seat of the Christian
covenant, and the great action of the Eucharist
is resumed, and the memories of the Upper
Chamber at Jerusalem are renewed at the altar of
Westminster. The Word is spoken and the Deed
is done. A great cloud of prayer and aspiration
and intercession floats up from the vast concourse
of assembled worshippers; and, in the midst of
them, the crowned and anointed King, kneeling
by her who must aid him to bear his burden,
seeks through the Divinely-appointed Medium
supernatural strength for a more than human
task. From a full heart and with the solemnest
intent a united nation says, "God save King
Edward."</p>

<p class="p1">The scene is changed from Westminster Abbey
to a dining-room in Belgravia, and the date from
Saturday, 9th August, to Sunday, 3rd. Thirty
guests, male and female, are gathered round a
too-bountiful board; and, amidst the rich fumes of
mayonnaise and quails and whitebait and champagne-cup,
there rise the mingled voices of the
great "Coronation Chorus."</p>

<p><i>Enthusiastic Young Lady.</i> "I can think of nothing
but the Coronation. Where are you going
to see it from?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Facetious Young Man.</i> "Oh! from Hurlingham.
That's quite near enough. The whole thing is
such a frightful bore. You know what they say
London is just now. All Board and no Lodging."</p>

<p><i>New Peeress.</i> "I really envy the duchesses.
They have such good places in the front row. I
shall be poked away under the gallery quite at the
back. I don't believe I shall see a thing. But,
after all, one will be able to say one has been
there."</p>

<p><i>Facetious Young Man.</i> "Oh! you could say that
anyhow. It's not good enough to get up at four
in the morning for the sake of saying that.
Charley FitzBattleaxe thinks just the same as I
do about it, but of course, as he's a peer, he's
bound to go. He's a bad hand at getting up
early, so he's going to sit up playing bridge all
night, and then have his bath and go straight to
the show."</p>

<p><i>Stout Peeress.</i> "Our creation is rather old, so
I have got a very good place, but the chairs are
too dreadful. Such stiff backs, and only nine
inches to sit on, and horrid wicker seats which
will make marks on our velvet."</p>

<p><i>Thrifty Peeress.</i> "Well, I really don't know
where I shall have my luncheon. It seems monstrous
to have to pay two guineas at the House of
Lords for a sandwich and a glass of claret. The
Watermans in Dean's Yard have most kindly
asked me to go to luncheon with them, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
would be an immense saving. But they are strict
teetotallers, and I feel that, after all those hours in
the Abbey, I shall want something more supporting
than lemonade. So I am rather divided. I
dread the idea of a teetotal luncheon, but two
guineas for a glass of claret and a sandwich is
rather much."</p>

<p><i>Nervous Peeress.</i> "I am so terrified of being
faint in the Abbey. I am going to take chocolate
and meat lozenges in my coronet, and some brandy
and water in my smelling-bottle."</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i> (confusedly). "Oh no, port wine is the
thing. No&mdash;rum and milk. My doctor says
whisky. Whisky? Oh no; sal volatile is much
the best, and Plasmon biscuits. Not sandwiches&mdash;I
hate sandwiches. Cold chicken. But can
we eat in church? Isn't it rather odd? Oh, the
Abbey isn't exactly a church, you know. Isn't
it? I should have thought it was. Well&mdash;no&mdash;our
Vicar tells me that it was never consecrated.
How very curious! At least it was only consecrated
by the Angels, not by the Bishop. Well,
of course that makes a difference. Still, I don't
like the idea of eating and drinking in it. So I
shall have some pâté de foie gras and champagne
in the carriage, and eat till the very moment I get
to the Abbey, and begin again the very moment I
get out."</p>

<p><i>Lively Young Lady.</i> "I'm not afraid of being
faint&mdash;only of being bored in that long wait. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
shall take something to read while mamma is stuffing
herself with her sandwiches."</p>

<p><i>Facetious Young Man.</i> "What a good idea!
Shall you take <i>Modern Society</i> or the <i>Pink 'Un</i>?"</p>

<p><i>Grave Young Lady</i> (intervening). "Neither, I
hope. People seem to forget that after all it is a
religious service. If one must read, I think 'John
Inglesant' or one of Miss Yonge's books would
be more suitable than a newspaper."</p>

<p><i>Lively Young Lady.</i> "Well, really, it is so difficult
to think of it as a religious service. It
seems to me more like a play. I saw one of the
rehearsals, and certainly it was as funny as a
pantomime. But still, of course, one wouldn't
wish to do anything that was unsuitable; so I
think I shall take a 'Guide-book to the Abbey'
and learn all the history while we are waiting.
One hears so much about it just now, and it
seems stupid not to know. I never can remember
whether St. Edward was Edward the Confessor
or Edward the Sixth. Do you know?"</p>

<p><i>Facetious Young Man.</i> "Oh, ask me an easier
one. Those old jossers were all pretty much of
a muchness. I tell you I'm not taking any. The
whole thing is utterly out of date. Why couldn't
he write his name in a book, or send a crier round
with a bell to say he's come to the throne?"</p>

<p><i>The Host.</i> "My dear Freddy Du Cane, I don't
agree with you the least. I am bound to say
quite honestly that all my life I have hoped that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I might live to see a Coronation, and I am honestly
thankful that I have got a place. It is all the things
that interest me most rolled into one&mdash;Pageant
and History and Patriotism and a great Religious
Ceremony. I am a Liberal; therefore I like the
Recognition and the Oath. I am a Ritualist;
therefore I like the vestments and the Unction and
the oblation of the Golden Pall. Above all I am
an Englishman, and I like to see my Sovereign
take up the duties of sovereignty at the altar of
'that Royal and National sanctuary which has for
so many centuries enshrined the varied memories
of his august ancestors and the manifold glories
of his free and famous kingdom.' Those words
are Dean Stanley's. Do you know his account of
the Coronation in his 'Memorials of Westminster
Abbey'? If you will let me, I will show it to
you after luncheon. People ought at least to know
what the service is before they presume to make
stupid jokes about it."</p>

<h2 class="p4">II</h2>

<p class="pch">SECRET SOCIETIES</p>

<p>When Lord Scamperdale was angry with Mr. Sponge
for riding over his hounds he called him
"a perpendicular Puseyite pig-jobber"; and the
alliteration was felt to emphasize the rebuke.
If any Home Ruler is irritated by Sir Robert
Anderson he may relieve his feelings by calling
him a "preaching political policeman," and each
word in the title will be true to life. Sir Robert
combines in his single person the characters of
barrister, detective, and theologian. He began life
at the Irish Bar, was for many years head of the
Criminal Investigation Department in London, then
became Assistant Commissioner of Police, and all
the while gave what leisure he could spare from
tracking dynamiters and intercepting burglars to
the composition of such works as "The Gospel
and its Ministry," "A Handbook of Evangelical
Truth," and "Daniel in the Critic's Den."</p>

<p>A career so diversified was sure to produce
some interesting reminiscences, and the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which Sir Robert has just published is as full of
mystery and adventure, violence and strategy, plot
and counterplot, as the romances which thrilled
our youth. In those days some boys thought
soldiering the one life worth living; some, in fancy,
ran away to sea. Some loved tales of Piracy,
and were peculiarly at home in a Smugglers' Cave.
Others snatched a fearful joy from ghosts and
bogies. Others enjoyed Brazilian forests and
African jungles, hand-to-hand encounters with
gorillas and hair-breadth 'scapes from watchful
tigers. The present writer thought nothing so
delightful as Secret Societies, and would have
given his little all to know a password, a sign,
or a secret code. Perhaps this idiosyncrasy was
due to the fact that in the mid 'sixties every
paper teemed with allusions to Fenianism, just
then a very active force in the political world;
and to Smith Minus, in the Fourth Form at
Harrow, there was something unspeakably attractive
in the thought of being a "Head Centre," a
"Director," or an "Executive Officer of the Irish
Republican Brotherhood," or even in the paler
glory of writing the mystic letters "F.B." or "C.O."
after his undistinguished name. It is in his account
of the earlier days of Fenianism that Sir Robert
Anderson is so intensely interesting. He traces it,
from its origin in the abortive rebellion of 1848
and that "Battle of Limerick" which Thackeray
sang, to its formal inauguration in 1860, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
subsequent activities at home and abroad; and
the narrative begins, quite thrillingly, with the
biography of the famous spy Henri le Caron,
who played so striking a part before the Commission
on Parnellism and Crime. Those who wish
to learn these incidents in our recent history, or
as much of them as at present can properly be
disclosed, must read Sir Robert's book for themselves.
I will not attempt even to epitomize it;
and, indeed, I only mention it because of the
"sidelights" which it throws, not on Home Rule,
but on the part which Secret Societies have played
in the fortunes of Modern Europe.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the only Englishman&mdash;if
Englishman he could properly be called&mdash;who regarded
the Secret Societies as formidable realities
was Lord Beaconsfield. As long ago as 1844&mdash;long
before he had official experience to guide him&mdash;he
wrote, with regard to his favourite Sidonia
(in drawing whom he drew himself):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The catalogue of his acquaintance in the shape
of Greeks, Armenians, Moors, Secret Jews, Tartars,
Gipsies, wandering Poles, and Carbonari would
throw a curious light on those subterranean agencies
of which the world in general knows so little, but
which exercise so great an influence on public
events."</p>

<p>Those were the days when Disraeli, a genius
whom no one treated seriously, was uttering his
inmost thoughts through the medium of romances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to which fancy contributed at least as much as
fact. Then came twenty years of constant activity
in politics&mdash;that pursuit which, as Bacon says, is
of all pursuits "the most immersed in matter,"&mdash;and,
when next he took up the novelist's pen, he
was a much older and more experienced, though
he would scarcely be a wiser, man. In 1870 he
startled the world with "Lothair"; and those who
had the hardihood to fight their way through all
the fashionable flummery with which the book
begins found in the second and third volumes a
profoundly interesting contribution to the history
of Europe between 1848 and 1868. One of the
characters says that "the only strong things in
Europe are the Church and the Secret Societies";
and the book is a vivid narrative of the struggle
for life and death between the Temporal Power of
the Papacy and the insurrectionary movements inspired
by Garibaldi. Every chapter of the book contains
a portrait, and every incident is drawn from
something which had come under the author's notice
between 1866 and 1869, when he was the leading
personage in the Tory Government and the Fenians
were making open and secret war on English rule.
He was describing the men whom he knew and
the things which he had seen, and this fact makes
the book so extraordinarily vivid, and won for it
Froude's enthusiastic praise. Every one could recognize
Capel and Manning and Antonelli and
Lord Bute, and all their diplomatic and fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
allies; it required some knowledge of the insurrectionary
movements to see in "Captain Bruges" a
portrait of General Cluseret, commander-in-chief
of every insurgent army in Europe or America, or
in Theodora the noble character of Jessie White-Mario,
whose career of romantic devotion to the
cause of Freedom closed only in this year.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"Madre Natura" in Italy, Fenianism in America
and England, the "Mary Anne" Societies of France,
and the mysterious alliance between all these
subterranean forces, are the themes of "Lothair,"
and the State trials of the time throw a good deal
of light upon them all. Even more mysterious,
much harder to trace, and infinitely more enduring
were the operations of the Carbonari&mdash;- beginning
with a handful of charcoal-burners in the forests
of Northern Italy, and spreading thence, always
by woodland ways, to the centre and north of
Europe. They promoted the French revolutions
of 1830 and 1848. Even Louis Napoleon allied
himself with them in his earlier machinations
against Louis Philippe and the Republic; and in the
Franco-German War of 1870 they rendered incalculable
service to the German troops by guiding
them through the fastnesses of the Ardennes. It is
one of the characteristics of the Secret Societies
that they attack the established order, without,
apparently, caring much what that order represents.
Their generals fought against England in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Canada and in Ireland; against the Northern
States in America; against Russia in the Danubian
Principalities. It is not to be supposed that in
1870 the Carbonari had much sympathy with the
military absolutism of Prussia; but Prussia was
attacking the French Empire, and that was enough
for the Carbonari.</p>

<p>Of course, as a general rule, the Secret Societies
of the Continent were anti-monarchical and anti-Christian;
but he who loves these mysterious
combinations can find plenty to interest him in
the history of organizations which were neither
Republican nor Atheistic. Nothing could be
more devotedly monarchical and orthodox than
the "Cycle of the White Rose." This Society,
profoundly "secret," was founded about the year
1727. It had for its object to unite all the
Cavalier and Nonjuring families of North Wales
and Cheshire, with a view to concerted action
when next the exiled Stuarts should claim their
own. The headquarters were always at Wynnstay,
and the Lady of Wynnstay was always Patroness.
The badge was a White Rose in enamel, and the
list of members was printed in a circle, so that if
it should fall into the hands of Government no
one should appear as ringleader or chief. The
Cycle was for some fifty years a real and definite
organization for political ends; but, as years went
on and the hopes of the Jacobites perished, the
Cycle degenerated into a mere dining-club, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
it expired in 1850. Its last member was, I
believe, the Rev. Sir Theophilus Puleston, who
lived to see the second Jubilee of Queen Victoria;
and the last Lady Patroness died in 1905.</p>

<p>Another Secret Society which once meant
practical mischief of no common kind was that
of the Orangemen. Though Orangemen are
nowadays vociferously loyal, their forerunners are
grossly misrepresented if it is not true that, under
the Grand-mastership of the Duke of Cumberland,
afterwards King Ernest of Hanover, they organized
a treasonable conspiracy to prevent Queen Victoria
from succeeding to the Throne of her ancestors
and to put her uncle in her place. For sidelights
on this rather dark passage of modern history the
curious reader is referred to "Tales of my Father,"
by "A. M. F.," and to a sensational rendering of
the same story, called "God Save the Queen."</p>

<p>My space is failing, and I must forbear to enlarge
on the most familiar and least terrifying of all
"Secret Societies." I hold no brief for the "Grand
Orient of France," even though Pius IX. may
once have belonged to this or a similar organization;
but I must profess that English Freemasons
are the most respectable, most jovial, and most
benevolent of mankind; and I trust that they will
accept in its true intention Cardinal Manning's
ambiguously worded defence of their craft,
"English Freemasonry is a Goose Club."</p>

<h2 class="p4">III</h2>

<p class="pch">THE IRISH PEERAGE</p>

<p>Dryasdust is proverbially a bore, and his forms
are Protean. Thus there are the Jacobite Dryasdusts,
who affirm that Queen Victoria had no
higher dignity than that of Dowager Princess Albert
of Saxe-Coburg, and deny that any act of sovereignty
transacted in this country has been valid
since that dark morning when James II., making the
best of his way to the Old Kent Road, dropped the
Great Seal into the Thames. Then there are the
Constitutional Dryasdusts, who deny the existence
of a Cabinet or a Prime Minister, and insist that
the Privy Council is the only Ministerial body
known to the law; and the Ecclesiastical Dryasdusts,
who affirm that the Church of England is
really free because the bishops are freely elected
by the Chapters of their respective Cathedrals,
acting under licence from a Sovereign who, having
been anointed, is a <i>Persona Mixta</i>&mdash;part layman,
part ecclesiastic. At the height of the South
African War I chanced to meet an Heraldic
Dryasdust, who moaned like a mandrake over the
announcement that the Duke of Norfolk had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
set out, with his Yeomanry, for the scene of action.
"You mean," I said, "that a valuable life is needlessly
imperilled?" "Not at all," replied Dryasdust,
with a face as long as a fiddle-case. "A far
more important consideration than the Duke's life
is involved. As Earl-Marshal he is supreme commander
of the forces of the Crown when engaged
in actual warfare, and the moment he sets his foot
on African soil Lord Roberts becomes subject to
his command. There is no way out of that constitutional
necessity, and I regard the outlook as
very serious." And so indeed it would have been,
had Dryasdust been right.</p>

<p>I am led to this train of reflections by the fact
that an eminent genealogist has lately tried to
frighten the readers of a Sunday paper by broaching
the theory that all the Acts of Parliament passed
within the last twenty years may have been invalid.
He does not commit himself to the statement that
they are invalid, but he insists that they may be,
and he grounds his contention on a clause of the
Act of Union. Concerning this clause he says,
following Sir William Anson, that it requires that
"the number of Irish peers, not entitled by the
possession of other peerages to an hereditary seat
in the House of Lords of the United Kingdom,
shall never fall below one hundred." Now it
seems that during the last twenty years the number
has fallen below a hundred; therefore the House
of Lords has not been properly constituted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
therefore its part in legislation has been null and
void. It is a startling theory, and like most startling
theories, will probably turn out to be nonsense;
but the history of the Irish Peerage, apart from
any consequences which may be deduced from it,
is full of interest, and not wholly free from scandal.
The Irish peerage, as it stands to-day, comprises
175 members; of these, 28 sit in the House of
Lords as Representative Peers, elected for life by
their brethren; 82 sit there because they hold
English as well as Irish peerages; and the remainder,
being merely Irish peers and not Representatives,
do not sit in the House of Lords, but
are eligible for the House of Commons. In this
respect their state is more gracious than that of the
Scotch peers, who cannot be elected to the House
of Commons, and therefore, unless they can get
themselves chosen to be Representative Peers of
Scotland, are excluded from Parliament for ever.
Still, though a seat in the House of Lords is a
desirable possession, a mere title has its charms.</p>

<p>It used to be said that when Mr. Smith the
banker, who lived in Whitehall, asked George III.
for the <i>entrée</i> of the Horse Guards, the King replied,
"I can't do that; but I wish to make you an Irish
Peer." However, the true version of the story
seems to be that which is given in the "Life of the
Marquis of Granby."</p>

<p>"In 1787 the owner of Rutland House desired
to increase the private <i>entrée</i> into Hyde Park to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dimensions of a carriage entrance, and asked
Charles, fourth Duke of Rutland, to support the
necessary application to the King. The Duke,
who was then Viceroy of Ireland, replied, 'You
will let me know whether ye application is to be
made to Lord Orford, who is ye Ranger of ye
Park, or to ye King himself: in ye latter case I
would write to Lord Sydney att ye same time; if
it be to the King a greater object might be easier
accomplished than this trifle, as I know he is very
particular about his Parks; at least he is so about
St. James Park, for he made a man an Irish Peer
to keep him in Good Humour for having refused
him permission to drive his carriage through ye
Horse Guards.'"</p>

<p>Lord Palmerston, himself an Irish peer, used
to say that an Irish peerage was the most convenient
of all dignities, as it secured its owner
social precedence while it left him free to pursue
a Parliamentary career. At the same time, greatly
as he enjoyed his position, Palmerston never would
take the oaths or comply with the legal formalities
necessary to entitle him to vote for the Irish Representative
Peers; and the reason for this refusal
was characteristic alike of an adroit politician and
of the unscrupulous age in which he lived. An
Irish peer who has proved his right to vote for the
Representative Peers, is eligible for election as a
Representative, and Palmerston feared that his
political opponents, wishing to get him out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
House of Commons into the comparative obscurity
and impotence of the House of Lords, would elect
him a Representative Peer in spite of himself, and
so effectually terminate his political activities. In
the days immediately succeeding Palmerston a
conspicuous ornament of the Irish Peerage was
the second Marquis of Abercorn. He had no need
to trouble himself about Representative arrangements,
for he sat in the House of Lords as a
peer of Great Britain, but his hereditary connexion
with the North of Ireland, his great estates
there, and the political influence which they gave
him, made him, in a very real sense, an Irish peer.
He was Lord-Lieutenant from 1866 to 1868, and
during his viceroyalty Disraeli (who subsequently
drew his portrait in "Lothair") conferred upon him
the rare honour of an Irish dukedom. It was
rumoured that he wished, in consideration of his
80,000 acres in Tyrone and Donegal, to become
the Duke of Ulster, but was reminded that Ulster
was a Royal title, borne already by the Duke of
Edinburgh. Be that as it may, he stuck to his
Scotch title, and became Duke of Abercorn. Down
to that time the Duke of Leinster had been the
sole Irish duke, and went by the nickname of
"Ireland's Only." To him, as an old friend, the
newly created Duke of Abercorn wrote a mock
apology for having invaded his monopoly; but
the Duke of Leinster was equal to the occasion,
and wrote back that he was quite content to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
henceforward the Premier Duke of Ireland. When,
six months later, Disraeli was driven out of office,
he conferred an Irish barony on a faithful supporter,
Colonel M'Clintock, who was made Lord
Rathdonnell; and it was generally understood
that, by arrangement between the leaders on both
sides, no more Irish peerages were to be created.
This understanding held good till Mr. George
Curzon, proceeding to India as Viceroy and contemplating
a possible return to Parliament when
his term of office expired, persuaded Lord Salisbury
to make him Lord Curzon of Kedleston in
the Peerage of Ireland.</p>

<p>But, after all, the Irish Peerage of to-day is to
a great extent the product of the Irish Union.
"There is no crime recorded in history&mdash;I do not
except the Massacre of St. Bartholomew&mdash;which
will compare for a moment with the means by
which the Union was carried." The student of
men and moods, having no clue to guide him,
would probably attribute this outburst to Mr.
Gladstone at some period between his first and
second Home Rule Bills; and he would be right.
For my own part, I can scarcely follow the allusion
to St. Bartholomew, but beyond doubt the
measures employed by the English Government
in order to secure the Union were both cruel and
base. It is the baseness with which we are just
now concerned. In order to carry the Union it
was necessary to persuade the Irish Houses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Lords and Commons, and to capture the whole
machinery of bribery and terrorism which directed
the Irish Parliament. As that blameless publicist
Sir T. Erskine May tranquilly observes, "corrupt
interests could only be overcome by corruption."
The policy of out-corrupting the corruptest was
pursued with energy and resolution. Each patron
of Irish boroughs who was ready to part with them
received £7500 for each seat. Lord Downshire
got £52,000 for seven seats; Lord Ely £45,000
for six. The total amount paid in compensation
for the surrender of electoral powers was
£1,260,000. In addition to these pecuniary inducements,
honours were lavishly distributed as
bribes. Five Irish peers were called to the House
of Lords, twenty were advanced a step in the
peerage, and twenty-two new peers were created.
It would be invidious, and perhaps actionable, to
attach proper names to the amazing histories of
Corruption by Title which are narrated in the
Private Correspondence of the Viceroy, Lord
Cornwallis, and the published Memoirs of Sir
Jonah Barrington. Even that sound loyalist Mr.
Lecky was constrained to admit that "the majority
of Irish titles are historically connected with
memories not of honour but of shame." On the
22nd January 1799 one member of the Irish
House of Commons took his bribe in the brief interval
between his speech for, and his vote against
a resolution affirming the right of the Irish nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to an independent Legislature. Another aspirant
to the peerage "made and sang songs against the
Union in 1799, and made and sang songs for it
in 1800." He got his deserts. A third secured
£30,000 for his surrendered boroughs, a peerage
for himself, and for his brother in Holy Orders an
archbishopric so wealthy that its fortunate owner
became a peer, and subsequently an earl, on his
own account. The scandalous tale might be indefinitely
prolonged; but enough has been said
to show why it is difficult to shed tears when these
strangely-engendered peerages sink below the
prescribed number of a hundred.</p>

<h2 class="p4">IV</h2>

<p class="pch">OMITTED SILHOUETTES</p>

<p>Last year<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I ventured to submit for public inspection
a small collection of Social Silhouettes. From
time to time during the last few months I have
received several kind enquiries about Omitted Portraits.
For instance, there is the Undertaker.
Perhaps a friend will write: "Dickens made
capital fun out of Mr. Mould and the 'Hollow <i>Elm</i>
Tree.' Couldn't you try your hand at something
of the same kind?" Another writes, perhaps a
little bluntly: "Why don't you give us the Barrister?
He must be an awfully easy type to do."
A third says, with subtler tact: "I feel that, since
Thackeray left us, yours is the only pen which can
properly handle the Actor"&mdash;or the Painter, or
the Singer, or the Bellringer, or the Beadle, as the
case may be. Now, to these enquiries, conceived,
as I know them all to be, in the friendliest spirit,
my answer varies a little, according to the type
suggested. With regard to the Barrister, I stated
quite early in my series that I did not propose
to deal with him, because he had been drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
repeatedly by the master-hands of fiction, and
because the lapse of years had wrought so little
change in the type that Serjeant Snubbin, and
Fitz-Roy Timmins, and Sir Thomas Underwood,
and Mr. Furnival, and Mr. Chaffanbrass were portraits
which needed no retouching. I must, indeed,
admit that the growth of hair upon the chin and
upper lip is a marked departure from type, and
that a moustached K.C. is as abnormal a being as
a bearded woman or a three-headed nightingale;
but the variation is purely external, and the true
inwardness of the Barrister remains what it was
when Dickens and Thackeray and Trollope drew
him. So, again, with regard to the Family Solicitor;
as long as men can study the methods of
Mr. Tulkinghorn (of Lincoln's Inn Fields) and
Mr. Putney Giles (of the same learned quarter)
they may leave Mr. Jerome K. Jerome in undisturbed
possession of his stage-lawyer, who "dresses
in the costume of the last generation but seven,
never has any office of his own, and (with the aid
of a crimson bag) transacts all his business at his
clients' houses."</p>

<p>When I am asked why I do not describe the
Painter, my reply is partly the same. We have
got Gaston Ph&oelig;bus, and Clive Newcome, and
Claude Mellot, and the goodly company of Trilby,
and we shall not easily improve upon those portraits,
whether highly finished or merely sketched.
But in this case I have another reason for reticence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
I know a good many painters, who about this time
of year bid me to their studios. I have experienced
before now the delicate irritability of the artistic
genius, and I know that a reverential reticence is
my safest course. Conversely, my reason for not
describing the Actor is that I really do not know
him well enough. An actor off the stage is about
as exhilarating an object as a theatre by daylight.
The brilliancy and the glamour have departed;
the savour of sawdust and orange-peel remains.
Let us render all honour to the histrion when his
foot is on his native boards; but if we are wise
we shall eschew in private life the society of Mr.
and Mrs. Vincent Crummles, nor open our door too
widely to the tribe of Costigan and Fotheringay.</p>

<p>The mention of that great actress's name (for
did not Emily Costigan, afterwards Lady Mirabel,
figure as "Miss Fotheringay" on the provincial
stage?) reminds me that, according to some of
my critics, women played too rare and too
secluded a part in my series of "Typical Developments."
It is only too true, and no one knows
as well as the author the amount of brilliancy and
interest which has been forfeited thereby. But
really it is a sacred awe that has made me mute.
Even to-day, as I write, I am smarting under a
rebuke recently administered to me, at a public
gathering, by an outraged matron. This lady
belongs to the political section of her tribe;
holds man, poor man! in proper contempt; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
clamours on Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's
doorstep for that suffrage which is to make her
truly free. At present she esteems herself little
better than a Squaw, and has been heard to
declare, in moments of expansive eloquence, that
she was not created to be the Toy of Man&mdash;a
declaration in which her hearers most heartily
concurred. Well, this stern guardian of her sex's
rights recently took me to task in a public place
for the levity with which I had criticized a gathering
of political ladies, and my nerve has scarcely
rallied from the sudden onslaught. Had I been
more myself I might even yet have tried my unskilled
hand at female portraiture. Perhaps, in
the spirit of that Cambridge professor who calls
William II. "quite the nicest Emperor I know," I
might have begun in the most illustrious circles,
and have sketched the stone-laying and bazaar-opening
activities of Royal Princesses. Or, yielding
precedence to the Church, I might have
discoursed of Episcopal ladies and have traced
the influence of a tradition received from the
beatified Mrs. Proudie. "<i>We</i> had a very nice
Ordination this Trinity," says one lady of this
class. "The Bishop and I were much disappointed
by the poor response of the laity to our
appeal," wrote another. When in May 1899
the Archbishops were playing at a Court for the
trial of Ritualism, Episcopal ladies sat knitting
by the judgment-seat, and stared at the incriminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
clergymen, as the <i>tricoteuses</i> of the French
Revolution may have stared at the victims of the
guillotine, or as Miss Squeers peered through the
keyhole at the flagellation of Smike. Or again,
on a lowlier rung of the Ecclesiastical ladder, I
might have drawn the Parochial Worker&mdash;the
woman of waterproof and gingham, the distributor
of tracts, the disciplinarian of the Sunday School,
the presiding spirit of Mothers' Meetings. At a
General Election this type of lady varies her
activities&mdash;canvasses for the Conservative candidate,
and tells the gaping washerwomen that
Mr. Lloyd-George wishes to convert the Welsh
cathedrals into music-halls for the Eisteddfod.
Of all Parochial Workers the highest type is the
Deaconess; and not long ago, in a parish with
which I am conversant, the Deaconess and the
Curate used to do their parochial rounds on a
double bicycle, to the infinite amusement of the
gutter-children and the serious perturbation of the
severely orthodox. There was a picture worthy
of the pen and pencil of Thackeray, but it faded
all too soon into the blurred commonplace of
matrimony.</p>

<p>The Deaconess may be called the Marine of
the Church's army, with one foot on sea and one
on shore&mdash;only half a Worldling, yet not quite a
Nun. With ladies of the last-named type, my
acquaintance has been prolonged and intimate.
Of their excellence and devotion it would be impertinent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to speak; but I may say without offence
that some of the ablest, most agreeable, and most
amusing women I have known I have encountered
in the Cloister. But, alas! even into the Cloister
the serpent of political guile will wend his sinuous
way; nor could I, though her friend, commend
the action of Sister G&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; when, in order
to prevent a patient in a Convalescent Home from
voting for a Radical candidate, she kept his trousers
under lock and key till the poll was over.</p>

<p>"Old age," it has been bitterly said, "when it
can no longer set a bad example, gives good
advice;" and when, as sometimes happens, I am
asked to hortate my younger fellow-citizens, one of
my most emphatic lessons is a Reverence for
Womanhood, even in its least ideal aspects. This,
I declare to be an essential attribute of the ideal
character&mdash;of that manhood, at once beautiful
and good, to which the philosophers have taught
us to aspire; and, lest I should seem to be violating
my own oft-repeated precept, I tear myself
from a fascinating theme.</p>

<p class="pch">DOCTORS AND DOCTORING</p>

<p>Sydney Smith, who was fond of quacking his
parishioners, and had a poor opinion of "professional
and graduated homicides," observes that
"the Sixth Commandment is suspended by one
medical diploma from the North of England to
the South." Personally, I have experienced the
attentions of the Faculty north, south, east, and
west, and I began in London. In my first appearance
on this planet I was personally conducted
by a smart gentleman, who came straight from a
dinner-party, in a large white cravat and turquoise
studs. Those studs still exist, and have descended,
with the practice, to his grandson. May they
beam on births more propitious than my own.</p>

<p>My knowledge of the first act of life's drama
is necessarily traditional. But, as I approach the
second, memory begins to operate. I seem to remember
a black silhouette of a gentleman in an
elbow-chair, with a pigtail and knee-breeches;
and this icon was revered as the likeness of "old
Doctor P&mdash;&mdash;." This "old Dr. P.'s" son, "Tom
P&mdash;&mdash;," was a sturdy stripling of seventy odd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
who had never used a stethoscope, and dismissed
a rival practitioner who talked about heart-sounds
as "an alarmist." To these succeeded a third
generation of the same drug-stained dynasty, represented
to me by a gentleman in shiny black, who
produced a large gold watch when he felt one's
pulse, and said "Hah!" when he looked at one's
tongue. These three generations, for something
more than a century, monopolized all the best
practice of Loamshire, were immensely respected,
and accumulated a great deal of money. Echoes
of the dialogue between doctor and patient still
haunt the ear of memory:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nervous and Dyspeptic Lady.</i> "Do you know, Dr.
P., I felt so very uncomfortable after luncheon&mdash;quite
a sensation of sinking through the floor.
Of course I had some brandy and water&mdash;about
half and half&mdash;at once, but I feel that I ought to
have a little champagne at dinner. Nothing helps
me so much."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. P.</span> "Your ladyship is no inconsiderable
physician. I was about to make the same suggestion.
But pray be careful that it is a dry wine."</p>

<p>All this was very comfortable and friendly, and
tended to promote the best relations between
doctor and patient. I do not recollect that the
doctor was supposed to effect cures; but his
presence at a deathbed created the pleasant sense
that all had been done which could be done, and
that the patient was dying with the dignity proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to his station. It may be remarked, in passing,
that the two elder generations did all their rounds,
early and late, summer and winter, on horseback;
while the third subsided into a brougham drawn
by a pair of horses afflicted with stringhalt, and
presumably bought cheap on account of that
infirmity.</p>

<p>So much for the men. What was their method?
To my infant palate the oils of castor and cod
were as familiar as mother's milk. I dwelt in a
land flowing with rhubarb and magnesia. The
lively leech was a household pet. "Two nocturnes
in blue and an arrangement in black," as the
Æsthete said, were of frequent occurrence. But
other parts of the system were more palatable. I
seem to have drunk beer from my earliest infancy.
A glass of port wine at eleven, with a teaspoonful
of bark in it, was the recognized tonic, and brandy
(which the doctor, who loved periphrasis, always
called "the domestic stimulant") was administered
whenever one looked squeamish, while mulled
claret was "exhibited" as a soporific. The notion
of pouring all this stuff down a child's throat
sounds odd to a generation reared on Apollinaris
and barley-water, but it had this one advantage&mdash;that
when one grew up it was impossible to make
one drunk.</p>

<p>From childhood we pass on to schooldays.
Wild horses should not drag from me the name
of the seminary where I was educated, for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
medical arrangements left a good deal to be desired.
There were three doctors in this place, and they
shared the care of some six hundred boys. Dr. A.
was certainly very old, and was reputed to be very
good, insomuch that his admirers said that, if they
were dying, they should wish to have Dr. A. with
them, as he was better than any clergyman. If,
however, they were so carnally-minded as to wish
to recover, they sent for Dr. B., a bluff gentleman,
who told his patients that they were not half as ill
as they thought, and must pull themselves together&mdash;a
prescription which, if there was nothing the
matter, answered admirably. The third was a
grievous gentleman, who took a dark view of life,
and, sitting by my sick-bed, would inform me of
the precarious condition of a schoolfellow, who, to
use his own phrase, was "slipping through his
fingers," and "had no more constitution than a
fly." Regarding this triumvirate in the light of
my subsequent experience, I cannot affect surprise
that there were fifteen deaths among the boys
during the five years that I was in the school.</p>

<p>From the anonymous school I proceeded to an
anonymous university, where the medical world
was dominated by the bland majesty of Sir Omicron
Pie (the name is Trollope's, but it will serve). Who
that ever saw them can forget that stately bearing,
that Jove-like brow, that sublime air of omniscience
and omnipotence? Who that ever heard it, that
even flow of mellifluous eloquence and copious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
narrative? Who that ever experienced it, the
underlying kindness of heart?</p>

<p>A nervous undergraduate is ushered into the
consulting-room, and the great man advances
with a paternal smile.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bumpstead? Ah! I think I was at school
with your good father. No? Then it must have
been your uncle. You are very like him. We
ran a neck-and-neck race at the University. I
won the Gold Medal, and he was <i>proximè</i>. In
those days I little thought of settling down in
Oxbridge. I had destined myself for a London
practice; but Sir Thomas Watson&mdash;you have
heard of 'Watson's style'? He was the Cicero
of Medicine&mdash;well, Watson said, 'No, my dear
Pie, it won't do. In ten years you will be at
the head of the profession, and will have made
£100,000. But, mark my words, <i>the blade will
wear out the scabbard</i>. You are not justified in
risking your life.' I was disappointed, of course.
All young men like the idea of fame. But I saw
that Watson was right, and I came here, and found
my life's work. The Medical School was then in
a very decayed condition, and I have made it what
it is. Why am I telling you all this&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>(<i>Enter the butler.</i>) "Please, Sir Omicron, you've
an appointment at Battle-axe Castle at four o'clock,
and the carriage is at the door."</p>

<p><i>Sir O. P.</i> "Ah! well. I must tell you the
rest another day. Let me see, what was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
matter? Palpitation? Let me listen for a moment.
It is as I thought&mdash;only a little functional irritability.
Lead a sensible life; avoid excess; cultivate
the philosophic temper. Take this prescription,
and come again next week. Thank you, thank
you."</p>

<p>Fortified by four years of Sir Omicron's care, I
came up to London somewhere between 1870 and
1880. The practice of the West End was then
divided between three men&mdash;Sir A. B., Sir C. D.,
and Sir E. F.</p>

<p>Sir A. B. was bluff and brutal, fashioned himself
on the traditions of Abernethy, and ruled his patients
by sheer terrorism. He had an immense influence
over hysterical women and weak-minded men, and
people who might otherwise have resented his
ursine manner were reconciled to it by the knowledge
that he officially inspected the most illustrious
Tongue in the kingdom.</p>

<p>His principal rival was Sir C. D., who ruled by
love. "Well, my dear sir, there is not much the
matter. A day or two's hunting will set you right.
You don't ride? Ah! well, it doesn't much matter.
A fortnight at Monte Carlo will do just as well.
All you want is change of scene and plenty of
amusement."</p>

<p>"As to your ladyship's diet, it should be light
and nutritious. I should recommend you to avoid
beefsteaks and boiled mutton. A little turtle soup,
some devilled whitebait, and a slice of a turkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<i>truffe</i> would be the sort of dinner to suit you. If
the insomnia is at all urgent, I have found a light
supper of pâté de foie gras work wonders."</p>

<p>Sir E. F. operated on a theological system.
His discourse on the Relations between Natural
and Revealed Religion profoundly impressed those
who heard it for the first time, and his tractate
on Medical Missions in India ran into a third
edition. In his waiting-room one found, instead
of last month's <i>Punch</i> or the Christmas number
of <i>Madame</i>, devotional works inscribed "From his
grateful patient, the author." In his consulting-room
a sacred picture of large dimensions crowned
the mantelpiece, and signed portraits of bishops
whom he had delivered from dyspepsia adorned
the walls. Ritualistic clergy frequented him in
great numbers, and&mdash;what was better still&mdash;recommended
their congregations to the "beloved
physician." Ecclesiastically-minded laymen delighted
in him, and came away with a comfortable
conviction, syllogistically arranged, that (1) one's
first duty is to maintain one's health; (2) whatever
one likes is healthy; therefore (3) one's first duty
is to like exactly as one likes.</p>

<p>A water-drinking adherent of Mr. Gladstone once
saw that eminent man crowning a banquet of
champagne with a glass of undeniable port. "Oh!
Mr. Gladstone," he exclaimed in the bitterness of
his soul, "what would Sir E. F. say if he could
see you mixing your liquors?" The great man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
defence was ready to his hand: "Sir E. F. assures
me that, if I let fifteen minutes elapse between two
kinds of wine, there is no mixture."</p>

<p>Somehow these lively oracles of Sir E. F.'s, with
which I was always coming in contact, left on my
mind a dim impression that he must have been
related to the doctor who attended Little Nell and
prescribed the remedies which the landlady had
already applied: "Everybody said he was a very
shrewd doctor indeed, and knew perfectly well
what people's constitutions were, which there
appears some reason to suppose he did."</p>

<h2 class="p4">VI</h2>

<p class="pch">MOURNING</p>

<p>My infant mind was "suckled in a creed outworn,"
in the form of a book called, by a strange misnomer,
a "Book of Useful Knowledge." It was
there stated, if my memory serves me, that "the
Chinese mourn in yellow, but Kings and Cardinals
mourn in purple." In what do modern English
people mourn? That is the subject of to-day's
enquiry.</p>

<p>Lord Acton, in one of his most impressive passages,
speaks of England as living under "institutions
which incorporate tradition and prolong
the reign of the dead." But the very notion of
"prolonging the reign of the dead" is an anachronism
in an age which forgets its friends the
moment it has buried them. "Out of sight, out of
mind" is an adage which nowadays verifies itself
with startling rapidity. Mourning is as much out
of date as Suttee; and, as to the Widow's Cap, the
admirable Signora Vesey Neroni in "Barchester
Towers" was only a little in advance of her age
when she exclaimed, "The death of twenty husbands
should not make me undergo such a penance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
It is as much a relic of paganism as the sacrifice
of a Hindoo woman at the burning of her husband's
body. If not so bloody, it is quite as barbarous
and quite as useless."</p>

<p>In days gone by, a death in a family extinguished
all festivity. Engagements were cancelled, social
plans were laid aside, and the mourners went
into retreat for a twelvemonth. Men wore black
trousers; women swathed themselves in black crape.
"Mourning Jewellery"&mdash;hideous combinations of
jet and bogwood&mdash;twinkled and jingled round the
necks of the bereaved, and widows wrote on letter-paper
which was virtually black, with a small white
space in the middle of the sheet. Harry Foker,
we know, honoured his father's memory by having
his brougham painted black; and I have known
a lady who, when she lost her husband, had her
boudoir lined with black velvet, after the fashion
of Lord Glenallan in "The Antiquary."</p>

<p>But nowadays people shrink (with amiable considerateness)
from thus inflicting their griefs on
their friends; and if (as we must in charity assume)
they feel emotion, they studiously conceal it in
their own bosoms. The ball follows the funeral
with a celerity and a frank joyousness which suggest
a Wake; and the keen pursuers of pleasure protest,
with quite a religious air, that for their own part
they would think it absolutely wicked to sorrow
as those without hope. Weedless widows, becomingly
"gowned," as Ladies' Papers say, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
pale grey or black and white, sacrifice to propriety
by forswearing the Opera or the Racecourse for
twelve months or so, but find a little fresh air on
the River or at Hurlingham absolutely necessary
for health; and, if they dine out quietly or even
give a little dance at home, are careful to protest
that they have lost all pleasure in life, but must
struggle to keep up for the sake of the dear children.
Surely, as Master Shallow says, "good phrases are,
and ever were, very commendable." The old-fashioned
manifestations of mourning were no
doubt overdone, but the modern disregard of the
dead seems to me both heartless and indecent.</p>

<p>The supreme exemplar of Mourning was, of
course, Queen Victoria. During her reign, and in
her personal practice, the custom of Mourning
reached its highest point of persistence and solemnity.
In 1844 Lady Lyttelton, who was governess
to the present King and his sister the Princess
Royal, wrote from Court, "We are such a 'boundless
contiguity of shade' just now." The immediate
cause of that shade was the death of Prince
Albert's father; and although in Queen Victoria's
life there was a fair allowance of sunshine, still,
as Ecclesiastes said, "the clouds return after the
rain"; and, in a family where cousinship is recognized
to the third and fourth generation, the
"shade" of mourning must constantly recur. The
late Duke of Beaufort, head of the most numerous
family in the Peerage, always wore a black band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
round his white hat, because, as he said, one of
his cousins was always dead and he would not be
wanting in respect for the deceased; and, similarly,
a Maid of Honour once said to me, "I never see
the Queen's jewels, because she is almost always
in mourning for some German prince or princess,
and then she only wears black ornaments."
Of course, in a case where there was this natural
predisposition to mournful observance, the
supreme loss of a husband meant a final renunciation
of the world and its gaieties. I suppose
it is no exaggeration to say that from her bereavement
in 1861 to her death in 1901 Queen Victoria
lived in unbroken communion with the unseen
but unforgotten. The necessary business of the
State was not, even for a week, laid aside; but
pomps and ceremonies and public appearances
are profoundly distasteful to shattered nerves and
broken hearts. Yielding to the urgent advice of
her Ministers, Queen Victoria emerged from four
years' seclusion to open the new Parliament in
1866; and her reward was reaped in the following
December, when a peculiarly rancorous politician
rebuked her at a great meeting of reformers in St.
James's Hall for a lack of popular sympathies. It
was then that, on the spur of the moment, John
Bright, who himself had known so well what
bereavement meant, uttered his chivalrous defence
of the absent and lonely Sovereign:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not accustomed to stand up in defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of those who are possessors of crowns. But I
could not sit and hear that observation without a
sensation of wonder and of pain. I think there
has been, by many persons, a great injustice done
to the Queen in reference to her desolate and
widowed position. And I venture to say this&mdash;that
a woman, be she the Queen of a great realm
or be she the wife of one of your labouring men,
who can keep alive in her heart a great sorrow for
the lost object of her life and affection, is not at
all likely to be wanting in a great and generous
sympathy with you."</p>

<p>Admirable and reverend as was this abiding
sorrow, contemporary observers felt that its outward
manifestations were not always harmonious.
The Mausoleum at Frogmore is not a "poem in
stone," and the Monument of Gilt opposite the
Albert Hall has supplied the frivolous with an
appropriate pun. Landseer, who, when once he
forsook his stags and deerhounds, was surely the
most debased painter of a hideous age, attained
his worst in a picture of the Slopes at Windsor
<i>circa</i> 1862. Under an inky sky, in the forefront of
a sunless landscape, stands a black pony, and on
its back is a lady dressed in the deepest weeds,
with a black riding-skirt and a black bonnet. A
retainer in subfusc kilt holds the pony's head, a
dingy terrier looks on with melancholy eyes, and, in
the distant background, two darkly-clad princesses
shiver on a garden-seat. The only spot of colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in the scene is a red despatch-box, and the whole
forms the highest tribute of English art to a
national disaster and a Queenly sorrow.</p>

<p>Black, and intensely black, were all the trappings
of courtly woe&mdash;black crape, black gloves,
black feathers, black jewellery. The State-robes
were worn no longer; the State-coach stood unused
in the coach-house. The footmen wore black
bands round their arms. It was only by slow
degrees, and on occasions of high and rare solemnity,
that white lace and modest plumes and
diamonds and decorations were permitted to enliven
the firmament of courtly woe. But we of
the twentieth century live in an age of æsthetic
revival, and, though perhaps we do not mourn
so heartily, we certainly mourn more prettily.
One lady at least there is who knows how to combine
the sincerity of sorrow with its becoming
manifestation; and Queen Alexandra in mourning
garb is as delightful a vision as was Queen Alexandra
in her clothing of wrought gold, when she knelt
before the altar of Westminster Abbey and bowed
her head to receive her diamond crown.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria's devotion to the memory of
those whom she had lost had one definite consequence
which probably she little contemplated.
The annual service, conducted in the Royal Mausoleum
at Frogmore on the anniversary of the
Prince Consort's death, accustomed English people
to the idea, which since the Reformation had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
become strangely unfamiliar, of devotional commemoration
of the Departed. To the Queen's
religious instincts, deeply tinged as they had been
by Prince Albert's Lutheranism, such commemorations
were entirely natural; for German Protestantism
has always cherished a much livelier sense
of the relation between the living and the departed
than was realized by English Puritanism.
The example set in high quarters quickly spread.
Memorial Services became an established form
of English mourning. Beginning with simple
prayers and hymns, they gradually developed into
Memorial Eucharists. The splendid, wailing
music of the <i>Dies Iræ</i> was felt to be the Christian
echo of the <i>Domine, Refugium</i>; and the common
instinct of mourning humanity found its appropriate
expression when, over the coffin of Prince
Henry of Battenberg, the choir of St. George's
Chapel sang the Russian hymn of supplication,
"Give rest, O Christ, to Thy servant with Thy
Saints."</p>

<h2 class="p4">VII</h2>

<p class="pch">WILLS</p>

<p>If there is any one still left who knows his
"Christian Year," he will remember that Keble extolled
"a sober standard of feeling" as a special
virtue of the English Prayer-book. I have always
thought that this "sober standard" is peculiarly
well exemplified by the rubric about Will-making
in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick: "If the
sick person hath not before disposed of his goods,
let him then be admonished to make his Will and
to declare his Debts, what he oweth and what is
owing unto him, for the better discharging of his
conscience and the quietness of his Executors. But
men should often be put in remembrance to take
order for the settling of their temporal estates whilst
they are in health." There is something in these
directions which is curiously English and commonplace
and unrhapsodical, and therefore exactly
congruous with the temper of a people who have
never set a high value on unpractical religions.
To this general duty of Will-making there may, of
course, be exceptions. Thus Dr. Pusey in his old
age, when his family was reduced to one and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
had no possessions left except his books, said:
"In a case like mine, the Law is the best willmaker."
A pietistic admirer, who had caught the
words imperfectly, in relating them substituted
"Lord" for "Law"; but the substitution did not
really affect the sense. In cases where no great
interests are involved and the requirements of
justice are not altogether clear, we can wisely
leave the eventual fate of our possessions to "God's
scheme for governing the Universe, by men miscalled
Chance."</p>

<p>There is, I believe, a certain school of economic
reformers who would wholly abolish the prerogative
of Will-making, and would decree that
whatever a man leaves behind him should pass
automatically to his children, or, failing them, to
the State. On the social and fiscal results of such
a system I forbear to speculate; but, as a sincere
friend to Literature in all its branches, I would
ask, if that were law, what would become of the
Novelists and the Playwrights? The law of Stageland
has been codified for us by the laborious care
of Mr. Jerome K. Jerome, and among its best-established
principles seem to be these: If a man
dies without leaving a will, then all his property
goes to the nearest villain; but, if a man dies and
leaves a will, then all his property goes to whoever
can get possession of that will. Here are the raw
materials of dramatic litigation enough to hold the
Stage for a century; and ill would it fare with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
embarrassed playwright if a mechanical process of
law were substituted for the strange possibilities of
Will-making, with its startling caprices, its incalculable
miscarriages, and its eventual triumph of
injured innocence. Then again, as to Fiction.
Foul fall the day when our fiction-writers shall be
unable to traffic any longer in testamentary mystification.
How would their predecessors have fared
if they had laboured under such a disability? I
am by nature too cautious to "intromit with" the
mysteries of Scotch law, and in the romances of
the beloved Sir Walter the complications of Entail
and of Will-making are curiously intertwined.
Certainly it was under the provisions of an entail
that Harry Bertram recovered the estates of Ellangowan,
and I am inclined to think that it was an
Entail which prompted the Countess of Glenallan
to her hideous crime; but it was by will that Miss
Margaret Bertram devised the lands of Singleside,
and it was under old Sir Hildebrand's will that
Francis Osbaldistone succeeded to Osbaldistone
Hall.</p>

<p>Even greater are the obligations of our English
novelists to the testamentary law. Miss Edgeworth
made admirable use of it in "Almeria."
Had Englishmen no power of making wills, the
"wicked Lord Hertford" could not have executed
the notorious instrument which gave such unbounded
delight to the scandalmongers of 1842-1843,
and then Lord Beaconsfield could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
drawn his Hogarth-like picture of the reading of
Lord Monmouth's will in "Coningsby." Thackeray
did not traffic very much in wills, though, to
be sure, Jos Sedley left £1000 to Becky Sharp,
and the opportune discovery of Lord Ringwood's
will in the pocket of his travelling-carriage simplified
Philip's career. The insolvent swindler Dr.
Firmin, who had robbed his son and absconded
to America, left his will "in the tortoiseshell secretaire
in the consulting-room, under the picture of
Abraham offering up Isaac." Dickens was a great
Will-maker. We know that if Dick Swiveller had
been a steadier youth he would have inherited
more than £150 a year from his aunt Rebecca.
That loyal-hearted lover Mr. Barkis, in spite of
all rebuffs, made the obdurate Peggotty his residuary
legatee. Mr. Finching left "a beautiful
will," and Madeline Bray was the subject of a
very complicated one. Mr. Dorrit's unexpected
fortune accrued to him, I think, as Heir-at-law;
but the litigation in Jarndyce <i>v.</i> Jarndyce arose,
as all the world knows, out of a disputed will;
and the Thellusson Will Case, on which Dickens
relied, in later years supplied Henry Kingsley
with the plot of "Reginald Hetherege." Perhaps
Dickens's best piece of Will-making is given
in the case of Mr. Spenlow, who, being a practitioner
in Doctors' Commons, spoke about his
own will with "a serenity, a tranquillity, a
calm sunset air" which quite affected David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Copperfield; and then shattered all poor David's
hopes by dying intestate.</p>

<p>Anthony Trollope made good use of a Will
and a Codicil in the plot of "Orley Farm."
George Eliot, whose disagreeable characters always
seem a good deal nearer life than her heroes
and heroines, made Mr. Casaubon behave very
characteristically in the odious will by which he
tried to prevent Dorothea from marrying Will
Ladislaw; and her picture of the disappointment
which fell upon the company when Peter
Featherstone's will was read is perhaps her best
achievement in the way of humour. "Nobody
present had a farthing; but Mr. Trumbull had
the gold-headed cane," which, considered as an
acknowledgment of his professional services to
the deceased, he was ungrateful enough to call
"farcical."</p>

<p>The Law of Settlement and Entail is no part of
our present study; but it may be remarked in
passing that the legal Opinion on the Base Fee by
which Harold Transome in "Felix Holt" held the
Transome Estates was written, at George Eliot's
request, by a young Chancery Barrister, who
still survives, a brilliant figure in the world of
Letters.</p>

<p>This is enough, and perhaps more than enough,
about Wills in fiction; but Wills in real life are
fully as interesting. The late Sir Charles Butt,
who presided over the Divorce Court and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Probate Court, once told me that, though the
aspect of human nature which is exhibited in
Divorce is not ideally beautiful, it is far less repulsive
than that which is disclosed by Probate.
None of the stories which one has read about
forged wills, forced wills, wills made under pressure,
wills made under misrepresentation, are too
strange to be true. A century ago the daughter
of a great landowner in the North of England
succeeded to his wealth under circumstances
which, to put it mildly, caused surprise. In later
life she had a public quarrel with a high-born
but intemperate dame, who concluded the colloquy
by observing, with mordant emphasis,
"Well, at any rate I didn't hold my dying
father's hand to make him sign a will he never
saw, and then murder the Butler to prevent his
telling." "Ouida," or Miss Braddon, or some
other novelist of High Life might, I think, make
something of this scene.</p>

<p>Spiteful Wills&mdash;wills which, by rehearsing and
revoking previous bequests, mortify the survivors
when the testator is no longer in a position to do
so <i>viva voce</i>&mdash;form a very curious branch of the
subject. Lord Kew was a very wealthy peer of
strict principles and peculiarly acrid temper, and,
having no wife or children to annoy, he "took it
out," as the saying is, of his brothers, nephews,
and other expectant kinsfolk. One gem from his
collection I recall, in some such words as these:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"By a previous will I had left £50,000 to my
brother John; but, as he has sent his son to Oxford
instead of Cambridge, contrary to my expressed
wish, I reduce the legacy to £500." May the
earth lie light on that benevolent old despot!
Eccentricities of bequest, again, might make a
pleasant chapter. The present writer, though not
yet in tottering age, can recall an annuitant whose
claim to £20 a year was founded (in part) on the
skill with which he had tied his master's pigtail,
and that master died in 1830. The proverbial
longevity of annuitants was illustrated in the case
of a grey parrot, for whose maintenance his departed
mistress left £10 a year. The bird was not
very young when the annuity began to accrue;
and, as years went on and friends dropped off, he
began to feel the loneliness of his lot. With a
tenderness of heart which did them infinite credit,
the good couple to whose care the bird had
been left imported a companion exactly like
himself to cheer his solitude. Before long one
of the parrots died, and the mourners remarked
that these younger birds had not half
the constitution of the older generation. So, as
long as they lived, the parrot lived, and the
pension lived also.</p>

<p>Let my closing word on Wills bear the authority
of a great name. To a retailer of news who
informed him that Lord Omnium, recently deceased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had left a large sum of money to
charities, Mr. Gladstone replied with characteristic
emphasis: "Thank him for nothing!
He was obliged to leave it. He couldn't carry
it with him."</p>

<h2 class="p4">VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">PENSIONS</p>

<p>"There is no living in this country under twenty
thousand a year&mdash;not that that suffices, but it entitles
one to ask a pension for two or three lives."
This was the verdict of Horace Walpole, who, as
Sir George Trevelyan antithetically says, "lived in
the country and on the country during more than
half a century, doing for the country less than
half a day's work in half a year." Talleyrand
said that no one could conceive how enjoyable a
thing existence was capable of being who had not
belonged to the <i>Ancienne Noblesse</i> of France before
the Revolution; but really the younger son of an
important Minister, General, Courtier, or Prelate
under our English Georges had a good deal to be
thankful for. It is pleasant to note the innocent
candour with which, in Walpole's manly declaration,
one enormity is made to justify another. A
father who held great office in Church or State or
Law gave, as a matter of course, all his most desirable
preferments to his sons. These preferments
enabled the sons to live in opulence at the public
charge, their duties being performed by deputy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The Clerk of the Rolls and the Clerk of the
Hanaper had no personal contact with the mysterious
articles to which they are attached. The
Clerk of the Irons, the Surveyor of the Meltings,
and the Accountant of Slops lived far remote
from such "low-thoughtéd cares." The writer of
this book deduces his insignificant being from a
gentleman who divided with a brother the lucrative
sinecure of Scavenger of Dublin, though
neither ever set foot in that fragrant city. A
nephew of Lord-Chancellor Thurlow (who survived
till 1874) drew pensions for abolished offices
to the amount of £11,000 a year; and a son of
Archbishop Moore was Principal Registrar of the
Prerogative Court of Canterbury from his boyhood
till the abolition of his Court in 1858, when
he was pensioned off with £10,000 a year.</p>

<p>When the sands of life were running in the
glass, it was customary for a filial placeman to
obtain further pensions for his sons and daughters,
on the obvious plea that it was cruel to cast young
men and women, who had been reared in comfort
on the mercies of a rough world. Thus the
golden chain of Royal bounty held at least three
lives together. The grandfather was First Lord
of the Treasury or Chancellor of the Exchequer
or Paymaster-General, and into his personal profits
it would be invidious, even indecent, to enquire.
He might make his eldest son, while still a boy at
Eton, Clerk of the Estreats, and his second, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
he took his degree at Cambridge, Usher of the
Exchequer. Thus Lord-Chancellor Erskine made
his son Secretary of Presentations when he was
eighteen, and Charles Greville was appointed
Secretary of Jamaica (where he never set his foot)
before he was twenty. And then when, after fifty
or sixty years of blameless enjoyment, the amiable
sinecurist was nearing his last quarter-day, a
benevolent Treasury intervened to save his maiden
daughters or orphan nieces from pecuniary embarrassment.
It was of such "near and dear
relations" of a public man that Sydney Smith
affirmed that their "eating, drinking, washing,
and clothing cost every man in the United Kingdom
twopence or threepence a year"; and, to the
critics who deprecated this commercial way of
regarding the situation, he replied, with characteristic
vigour: "I have no idea that the Sophias and
Carolines of any man breathing are to eat national
veal, to drink public tea, to wear Treasury ribands,
and then that we are to be told that it is coarse
to animadvert upon this pitiful and eleemosynary
splendour. If this is right, why not mention it?
If it is wrong, why should not he who enjoys the
ease of supporting his sisters in this manner bear
the shame of it?" In thus writing of the Pension
List as it stood in 1807, the admirable Sydney was
at once the successor of Burke and the forerunner
of Lord Grey. In 1780 Burke had addressed all
the resources of his genius to the task of restoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the independence of Parliament by economical
reform. It was, as Mr. Morley says, the number
of sinecure places and unpublished pensions which
"furnished the Minister with an irresistible lever."
Burke found that "in sweeping away those factitious
places and secret pensions he would be
robbing the Court of its chief implements of corruption
and protecting the representative against
his chief motive in selling his country." His
power of oratory was reinforced by a minute
knowledge of all the shady and shabby abuses, all
the manifold and complicated corruptions, which
had accumulated under the protection of the Royal
name. The reformer's triumph was signal and
complete. Vast numbers of sinecures were swept
away, but some remained. The Pension List
was closely curtailed, but pensions were still conferred.
No public servant ever more richly earned
a provision for his old age and decrepitude than
Burke himself; but when, broken by years and
sorrows, he accepted a pension from the Crown,
a Whig Duke of fabulous wealth, just thirty years
old, had the temerity to charge him with a discreditable
departure from his former principles of
economic reform. The Duke was a booby: but
his foolhardiness enriched English literature with
"A Letter to a Noble Lord on the Attacks made
on Mr. Burke and his Pension." To read that
Letter, even after the lapse of 110 years, is to
realize that, in spite of all corruption and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
abuse, pecuniary rewards for political service need
not be dishonourable or unreasonable.</p>

<p>But corruption and abuse there were, and
in sufficient quantities to justify all the bitter
fun which "Peter Plymley" poured upon the
Cannings, the Jenkinsons, and the Percevals. The
reform of the Pension List became a cardinal
object of reforming Radicals; and politicians like
Joseph Hume, publicists like Albany Fonblanque,
pursued it with incessant perseverance,</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Till Grey went forth in 'Thirty-two to storm Corruption's hold."</p>

<p class="pn1">In 1834 the first Reformed Parliament overhauled
the whole system and brought some curious transactions
into the light of day. Whereas up to that
time the Pension List amounted to £145,000 a
year, it was now reduced to £75,000; and its
benefits were restricted to "servants of the Crown
and public, and to those who by their useful
discoveries in science or attainments in literature
and the arts had merited the gracious consideration
of their Sovereign and the gratitude of their
country." Vested interests were, of course, respected;
for had we not even compensated the
slaveholders? Two years ago one of these beneficiaries
survived in a serene old age, and, for all
I know, there may be others still spared to us, for,
as Mr. G. A. Sala truly remarked, it never is safe
to say that any one is dead, for if you do he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sure to write from the country and say he is only
ninety-seven and never was better.</p>

<p>A typical representative of the unreformed
system was John Wilson Croker (1780-1857),
whose literary efforts Macaulay trounced, and
whose political utterances were thus described
by Lord Beaconsfield:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There never was a fellow for giving a good
hearty kick to the people like Rigby. Himself
sprung from the dregs of the populace, this was
disinterested. What could be more patriotic and
magnanimous than his jeremiads over the fall of
the Montmorencis and the Crillions, or the possible
catastrophe of the Percys and the Seymours?
The truth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby
had a sly pension which, by an inevitable association
of ideas, he always connected with the maintenance
of an aristocracy. All his rigmarole
dissertations on the French Revolution were impelled
by this secret influence; and, when he
moaned like a mandrake over Nottingham Castle
in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to
quarter-day."</p>

<p>It was an evil day for those who love to grow
rich upon the public money when Mr. Gladstone
became the controller of the National Purse. One
of his first acts was to revise the system of political
pensions, which by an Act of 1869 was reconstituted
as it stands to-day. There are now three
classes of persons entitled to pensions for services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rendered in political office; and the scale is
arranged on that curious principle which also
regulates the "tips" to servants in a private house&mdash;that
the larger your wage is, the larger your
gratuity shall be. Thus a Minister who has drawn
£5000 a year is entitled after four years' service
to a pension of £2000 a year; he who has drawn
£3000 a year for six years is entitled to £1200 a
year; while he who has laboured for ten years
for the modest remuneration of £1000 a year
must be content with a pittance of £800 a year.
<i>Qui habet, dabitur ei</i>; but with this restriction&mdash;that
only four pensions of any one class can run concurrently.</p>

<p>Politicians who had been brought up in the
"spacious days" and generous methods of the
older dispensation were by no means enamoured
of what they used to call "Gladstone's cheeseparing
economies." Sir William Gregory used to
relate how, when, as a child, he asked Lord Melbourne
for a fine red stick of official sealing-wax,
that genial Minister thrust it into his hand, together
with a bundle of quill pens, saying, "You can't
begin too early. All these things belong to the
public, and your business in life must be to get
out of the public all you can." An eminent
statesman, trained in these traditions, had drawn
from very early days a pension for an abolished
office in Chancery. In due course he became a
Cabinet Minister, and, when he fell from that high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
estate, he duly pocketed his £2000 a year. Later
he came into a very large income, but this he
obligingly saved for his nephews and nieces, living
meanwhile on his twofold pension.</p>

<p>I will conclude with a pleasanter anecdote.
Until half-way through the last century it was
customary to give a Speaker on retiring from the
House of Commons a pension of £2000 a year for
two lives. It is related that in 1857 Mr. Speaker
Shaw-Lefevre, on his elevation to the peerage as
Lord Eversley, said that he could not endure the
thought of imposing a burden on posterity, and
would therefore take £4000 a year for his own life
instead of £2000 a year for two. This public-spirited
action was highly commended, and, as he
lived till 1888, virtue was, as it ought always to
be, its own reward.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">IX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SEASON AS IT WAS</p>

<p>The subject is worthy to be celebrated both in verse
and in prose. Exactly sixty years ago Bulwer-Lytton,
in his anonymous satire "The New Timon,"
thus described the nocturnal aspect of the West
End in that choice period of the year which to us
Londoners is pre-eminently "The Season":&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">
"O'er Royal London, in luxuriant May,<br />
While lamps yet twinkle, dawning creeps the day.<br />
Home from the hell the pale-eyed gamester steals;<br />
Home from the ball flash jaded Beauty's wheels;<br />
From fields suburban rolls the early cart;<br />
So rests the Revel&mdash;so awakes the Mart."</p>

<p class="pn1">Twenty-four years later Lord Beaconsfield, in
"Lothair," gave a vivid sketch of the same scenes
as beheld by daylight:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Town was beginning to blaze. Broughams
whirled and bright barouches glanced, troops of
social cavalry cantered and caracolled in morning
rides, and the bells of prancing ponies, lashed by
delicate hands, gingled in the laughing air. There
were stoppages in Bond Street&mdash;which seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cap the climax of civilization, after crowded clubs
and swarming parks."</p>

<p>It is curious that of the two descriptions the
earlier needs much less revision than the later.
Lamps still "twinkle" (though, to be sure, they
are electric, whereas when Bulwer-Lytton wrote
gas had barely ousted oil from its last fastness in
Grosvenor Square). "Hells," though more euphemistically
named, still invite the domiciliary visits
of our much-aspersed police. "Beauty" dances
even more vigorously than in 1846, for Waltzes
and Kitchen-Lancers and Washington Posts have
superseded the decorous quadrilles which our
mothers loved. And still the market-gardens of
Acton and Ealing and Hounslow send their "towering
squadrons" of waggons laden heavens-high with
the fruits and vegetables for to-morrow's luncheon.
In this merry month of May 1906 an observer,
standing at Hyde Park Corner "when the night
and morning meet," sees London substantially as
Bulwer-Lytton saw it.</p>

<p>But, when we turn to Lord Beaconsfield's
description, the changes wrought by six-and-thirty
years are curiously marked. "Bright barouches
glanced." In the present day a Barouche, the
handsomest and gracefullest of all open carriages,
is as rare as an Auk's Egg or an original Folio of
Shakespeare. Only two or three survive. One,
richly dight in royal crimson, bears the Queen,
beautiful as Cleopatra in her barge. In another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
almost imperially purple, Lady Londonderry sits
enthroned; a third, palely blue as the forget-me-not,
carries Lady Carysfort; but soon the tale
of barouches ends. Victorias and landaus and
"Clarences" and "Sociables" make the common
throng of carriages, and their serried ranks
give way to the impetuous onrush of the noxious
Motor or the milder impact of the Electric
Brougham.</p>

<p>"Troops of social cavalry" were, when Lord
Beaconsfield wrote "Lothair," the characteristic
glories of Rotten Row; but horses and horsemanship
alike have waned. Men take their constitutional
canter in costumes anciently confined to
rat-catching, and the general aspect of Rotten
Row suggests the idea of Mounted Infantry
rather than of "Cavalry." Alongside the ride
forty years ago ladies drove their pony-phaetons&mdash;a
pretty practice and a pretty carriage; but
both have utterly disappeared, and the only
bells that "gingle in the laughing air" are
the warning signals of the Petrol Fiend, as,
bent on destruction, he swoops down from
Marble Arch to Piccadilly. Does a captious
critic gaze enquiringly on the unfamiliar verb
to "gingle"? It was thus that Lord Beaconsfield
wrote it in "Lothair"; even as in the
same high romance he described a lady with
a rich bunch of "Stephanopolis" in her hand.
It is not for the ephemeral scribbler to correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the orthography of the immortal dead. As to
"stoppages in Bond Street," they were isolated
and noteworthy incidents in 1870; in 1906, thanks
to the admission of omnibuses into the narrow
thoroughfare, they are occurrences as regular as
the postman's knock or the policeman's mailed
tread.</p>

<p>We have seen the aspects in which the London
Season presented itself to two great men of yore.
Let me now descend to a more personal level.
We will imagine ourselves transported back to the
year 1880, and to the month of May. A young
gentleman&mdash;some five-and-twenty summers, as
Mr. G. P. R. James would have said, have passed
over his fair head&mdash;is standing near the steps of
St. George's Hospital between the hours of eleven
and midnight. He is smartly dressed in evening
clothes, with a white waistcoat, a gardenia in his
button-hole, and a silver-crutched stick in his
hand. He is smoking a cigarette and pondering
the question where he shall spend his evening, or,
more strictly, the early hours of next day. He is
in a state of serene contentment with himself and
the world, for he has just eaten an excellent dinner,
where plovers' eggs and asparagus have reminded
him that the Season has really begun. To the
pleasure-seeking Londoner these symptoms of returning
summer mean more, far more, than the
dogrose in the hedgerow or the first note of the
nightingale in the copse. Since dinner he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
just looked in at an evening party, which bored
him badly, and has "cut" two others where he
was not so likely to be missed. And now arises
the vital question of the Balls. I use the plural
number, for there will certainly be two, and probably
three, to choose from. Here, at St. George's
Hospital, our youth is at the centre of the world's
social concourse. A swift and unbroken stream
of carriages is pouring down from Grosvenor
Square and Mayfair to Belgrave Square and Eaton
Square and Chesham Place, and it meets as it
goes the ascending procession which begins in
Belgravia and ends in Portman Square. To-night
there is a Royal Ball at Grosvenor House, certainly
the most stately event of the season; a little dance,
exquisitely gay and bright, in Piccadilly; and a
gorgeous entertainment in Prince's Gate, where
the aspiring Distiller is struggling, with enormous
outlay, into social fame. All these have solicited
the honour of our young friend's presence, and
now is the moment of decision. It does not
take long to repudiate Prince's Gate; there will
be the best band in London, and ortolans for
supper, but there will be no one there that one
ever saw before, and it is too sickening to be
called "My boy" by that bow-windowed bounder,
the master of the house. There remain Grosvenor
House and Piccadilly, and happily these can
be combined in a harmonious perfection. Grosvenor
House shall come first, for the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the Prince and Princess is a pageant worth seeing&mdash;the
most gracious host and the most beautiful
hostess in London ushering the Royal guests,
with courtly pomp, into the great gallery, walled
with the canvases of Rubens, which serves as
the dancing-room. Then the fun begins, and the
bright hours fly swiftly, till one o'clock suggests
the tender thought of supper, which is served on
gold plate and Sèvres china in a garden-tent of
Gobelins tapestry. And now it is time for a
move; and our youth, extricating himself from
the undesired attentions of the linkmen, pops into
a hansom and speeds to Piccadilly, where he finds
delights of a different kind&mdash;no Royalty, no pomp,
no ceremony; but a warm welcome, and all his
intimate friends, and the nicest girls in London
eager for a valse.</p>

<p>As day begins to peep, he drinks his crowning
tumbler of champagne-cup, and strolls home
under the opalescent dawn, sniffing the fragrance
from pyramids of strawberries as they roll towards
Covent Garden, and exchanging a friendly
"Good night" with the policeman on the beat,
who seems to think that "Good morning" would
be a more suitable greeting. So to bed, with
the cheerful consciousness of a day's work well
done, and the even more exhilarating prospect
of an unbroken succession of such days, full of
feasting and dancing and riding and polo and
lawn-tennis, till August stifles the Season with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
its dust and drives the revellers to Homburg or
the moors.</p>

<p>But I awake, and lo! it is a dream, though a
dream well founded on reality. For I have been
describing the London Season as it was when the
world was young.</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"When all the world is old, lad,<br />
And all the trees are brown;</p>
<p class="pin4">And all the sport is stale, lad,<br />
And all the wheels run down;</p>
<p class="pin4">Creep home, and take your place there,<br />
The spent and maimed among:</p>
<p class="pin4">God grant you find one face there,<br />
You loved when all was young."</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">X</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SEASON AS IT IS</p>

<p>That delicate critic, the late Mr. William Cory,
observes in one of his letters that Virgil's</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Sunt lacrymæ rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt"</p>

<p class="pn1">has its modern equivalent in Wordsworth's</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Men are we, and must grieve when even the shade<br />
Of that which once was great is passed away."</p>

<p class="pn1">The full luxury of that grief is reserved for those
who, a decade hence, shall moralize on "the
London Season," for the thing which now we so
describe will then have utterly perished, and its
name will only arouse a tender and regretful
emotion. Even now we have seen its glories fade,
and soon it will have shared the fate of those
Venetian splendours which Wordsworth mourned.
But in the meantime it still exists, though in a
vastly different form from that which it wore in
mid-Victorian years. Just now I was describing
some of the changes which have occurred since
the distant days when Bulwer-Lytton and Lord
Beaconsfield described London in May; and,
following humbly in their wake, I endeavoured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
depict it as it was when I had my part in it. But
change only yields place to change. Society, like
the individuals who compose it, passes onward in
perpetual vicissitude. As Shelley says, "Naught
may endure but mutability." So the London
Season of 1906 differs as notably from the
Season of 1880 as the Season of 1880 from that
of 1846. Let me catalogue some of the changes
and try to account for them. In the first place,
the Season is much less exactly circumscribed by
dates. In days gone by, it began with the Opening
of Parliament, which was always about the 7th of
February, and it lasted, with its regular intermissions
for Easter and Whitsuntide, till the last
week of July. Then Society transported itself in
turn to Goodwood, to Cowes, and to a German
watering-place or a Scotch moor, according to its
physical condition, and it was darkly rumoured
that, if people found themselves compelled by
domestic or financial reasons to remain in London
during August, they sought to escape detection by
keeping the windows fronting the street closely
shuttered, and lived in their back rooms in unbroken
contemplation of the leads and the mews.
If you chanced to meet a man in Piccadilly in
September, you might be sure that he would be
wearing country clothes and would assure you that
he was only "passing through" between Doncaster
and Scotland. Nowadays the Season has no particular
limits. London is nearly as full in December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as it is in May. Dinners and plays and suppers at
restaurants are as frequent, and, barring the fogs,
as bright, at Christmas as at Midsummer. Even
in September Clubland is not deserted; and there
are people bold enough to defy the world by returning
from their summer exodus as early as
October. The reason for the change, as for many
others like it, is the reduction of territorial incomes.
1880 may be taken as, roughly, the last of the
good years for agriculture. The incessant rains
of 1879 had even then begun to tell their tale.
Tenants were asking for big reductions, and farms
hitherto eagerly sought were becoming unlettable.
I know a landowner on a great scale who, a year
or two later, only pocketed 10 per cent. of his income
from land, whereas five years before he
would have thought an abatement of 10 per cent.
disastrous. All this has told increasingly on social
life, for people found themselves unable to keep
both a country house and a London house going
at the same time, and, being driven to choose
between the two, often decided to let the country
house and its shooting and make London their
headquarters for the whole year. So, by degrees,
autumn faded imperceptibly into winter, winter
into spring, and spring into summer. Each
season in its turn found people dwelling peaceably
in their urban habitations, entertaining and
being entertained; and so "<i>the</i> Season" lost its
sharp edges. The meeting of Parliament brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
no perceptible change in the aspect of the town.
"High Midsummer Pomps" were no longer so
"high" as in former years, but, <i>per contra</i>, there
was much more gaiety in the autumn and winter
and early spring.</p>

<p>Another cause which has contributed to the
effacement of the ancient time-marks is that the
Court tends to disregard them. Under the present
reign, Windsor Castle has become as much a social
centre as Buckingham Palace. There are banquets
in St. George's Hall in December, as well as
garden-parties on the the Slopes in June; and so,
under the action of Royal influence, the social
seasons melt into one another, like the hues of the
prism. Then, again, the practice of the "Weekend,"
imported from Lancashire and sanctioned
by Westminster, helps to denude the town in
summer; for the "end" tends naturally to prolong
itself till it overlaps the beginning, and Friday-to-Tuesday
parties, treading on the heels of Whitsuntide
and to be followed in quick succession by
Ascot, make mish-mash of what was aforetime
"an entire and perfect chrysolite"&mdash;a complete
and continuous whole.</p>

<p>In describing my hero of 1880 as he surveyed
his evening's amusements and chose the most
rewarding, I took for granted that he had at least
three balls to choose from. Nowadays he is
lucky if he has one. Here again, and conspicuously,
agricultural depression has made its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mark. In the years between 1870 and 1880,
during an unbroken spell of good trade and good
harvests, rich people struggled with one another
for a vacant night on which to entertain their
friends. For example, Lady A. had just brought
out a daughter, and wished to give a ball for her
benefit. Say that she set her affections on
Monday the 28th of May. Before she issued her
cards she took counsel with all her friends, for in
those days ball-giving mothers were a sort of
Limited Company, and all knew one another.
She found that Mrs. B. had mentally fixed on
Tuesday, 29th, and, if Mrs. C. had thought of
Monday, she would be so kind as to take Wednesday,
30th. So all was amicably agreed; there
would be no clashing, which would be such a pity
and would spoil both balls; and the cards were
duly issued. Directly afterwards, as if moved by
some occult and fiendish impulse, the Duchess
of D&mdash;&mdash; pounced on Monday, 28th, for a Royal
Ball at D&mdash;&mdash; House, or, worse still because more
perilously tempting, for a "very small dance,"
to which all the nicest young men would go,
and where they would stay till three. In the face
of such mortifications as these, the emulous hospitalities
of the aspiring Distiller were of no account;
for the "nice men" would either disregard them,
or, having looked in for half-an-hour, would come
on to spend the night at the houses where they
felt themselves at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The hero of 1880, if only he was well connected,
well mannered, and sufficiently well known, might
fairly reckon on dining six nights out of the seven
at a host's expense. Indeed, if he was at all
popular, he could safely afford to decline the invitation
which old Mr. Wellbore issued six weeks in
advance and reserve himself for a livelier meal at
shorter notice. Not so to-day. Our young friend,
if he has a constitutional objection to paying for
his own dinner, must take what he can get in the
way of invitations, and not be too particular about
the cook or the company. Here the cause of
change is not decrease of wealth. As long as
there is a balance at the bank, and even when
there is none, people will dine; and dinner-giving
is the last form of hospitality which Society will
let die. But nowadays dinners are made ancillary
to Bridge. If our friend cannot afford to lose
£50 in an evening he will not be asked to dine at
a house which reckons itself as belonging to "the
Mode"; or if, for old acquaintance' sake, he is
allowed to find a place at the dinner-table, he is
compelled to sit all the evening by the least attractive
daughter of the house, or to listen to some
fogey, too fossilized for Bridge, discoursing on the
iniquities of Mr. Birrell's Bill. "Tobacco," said
Lord Beaconsfield, "is the Tomb of Love." If
he were with us now, he would pronounce that
Bridge is the Extinguisher of Hospitality.</p>

<p>Yet once again I note a startling discrepancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
between the Season as it was and the Season as
it is. Then a young man who wanted air and
exercise in the afternoon played tennis at Lord's,
or skated at Prince's, or took a gallop in Richmond
Park, or, if he was very adventurous and up-to-date,
sped out to Hampton Court or Windsor on
a bone-shaking bicycle six feet high. All these
recreations are possible to him to-day; but all
have yielded to motoring. Dressed in the most
unbecoming of all known costumes, his expressive
eyes concealed by goggles, and his graceful proportions
swathed in oilskin, he urges his mad
career to Brighton or Stratford or Salisbury Plain.
No doubt he has the most fascinating companions
in the world, for girls are enthusiastic motorists;
but I fancy that Edwin and Angelina presented a
more attractive appearance when, neatly dressed
and beautifully mounted, they rode in the cool of
the evening along the shady side of Rotten Row.</p>

<p>However, I am a kind of social "Old Mortality"
rummaging among the tombs of what has been
and can be no more, and I fancy that Old Mortality's
opinions on youth and beauty would have
been justly disregarded.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SINS OF SOCIETY</p>

<p>In the year 1870 a flame of religious zeal was
suddenly kindled in the West End of London.
In that year the Rev. George Howard Wilkinson
(now Bishop of St. Andrews) was appointed Vicar
of St. Peter's, Eaton Square. The church in the
Belgravian district was as dry as tinder; it caught
fire from Mr. Wilkinson's fervour, and the fire
soon became a conflagration. This is Matthew
Arnold's description of the great preacher at the
height of his power: "He was so evidently sincere,
more than sincere, burnt up with sorrow, that he
carried every one with him, and half the church
was in tears. I do not much believe in good
being done by a man unless he can give <i>light</i>, and
Wilkinson's fire is very turbid; but his power
of heating, penetrating, and agitating is extraordinary."
This description belongs to the year
1872, but it might have been written with equal
truth at any date between 1870 and 1883. In
all my experience of preaching (which is long,
wide, and varied) I have never seen a congregation
dominated by its minister so absolutely as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
congregation of St. Peter's was dominated by Mr.
Wilkinson. I say "congregation" advisedly, for
I should think that at least half the seatholders
belonged to other parishes. The smartest carriages
in London blocked the approach to the church.
The great dames of Grosvenor Square and Carlton
House Terrace rubbed shoulders with the opulent
inhabitants of Tyburnia and South Kensington,
Cabinet Ministers fought for places in the gallery,
and M.P.'s were no more accounted of than silver
in the days of Solomon.</p>

<p>And this was not a mere assemblage of hearers.
The congregation of St. Peter's were pre-eminently
givers. £4000 a year was the regular product of
the alms-bags, let alone the innumerable sums
sent privately to the Vicar. "I want a thousand
pounds." This simple but emphatic statement
from the pulpit one Sunday was succeeded on the
following Sunday by the quiet announcement, "I
have got a thousand pounds." What was the
secret of this attraction? It was entirely personal.
It did not in the least depend on theological bias.
Mr. Wilkinson belonged to no party. He had
begun life as an Evangelical, and he retained the
unction and fervour which were characteristic of
that school at its best; but he was feeling his way
towards a higher churchmanship, and had discarded
most of his earlier shibboleths. The fabric
was frankly hideous, and the well-meant attempts
to make it look less like a barn and more like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
church only resulted in something between a
mosque and a synagogue. There was no ritualism.
The music was too elaborate for the choir, and
the curates were feeble beyond all description.
The Vicar was everything; and even he had none
of the gifts which are commonly supposed to make
a Popular Preacher. He was not the least flummery
or flowery. He was reserved and dignified
in manner, and his language was quite unadorned.
His voice was a monotonous moan, occasionally
rising into a howl. He was conspicuously free
from the tendency to prophesy smooth things,
and he even seemed to take a delight in rubbing
the pungent lotion of his spiritual satire into the
sore places of the hearers' conscience. If Jeremiah
had prophesied in a surplice, he would have been
like the Prophet of Belgravia; and as for Savonarola,
his sermon, as paraphrased in chapter xxiv.
of "Romola," might have been delivered, with
scarcely a word altered, from the pulpit of St.
Peter's.</p>

<p>And here we touch the pith and core of Mr.
Wilkinson's preaching. He rebuked the Sins of
Society as no one had ventured to rebuke them
since the days of Whitefield and the Wesleys. The
Tractarian Movement, so heart-searching, so conscience-stirring
at Oxford, had succumbed in the
fashionable parts of London to the influences
which surrounded it, and had degenerated into a
sort of easy-going ceremonialism&mdash;partly antiquarian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
partly worldly, and wholly ineffective for
spiritual revival or moral reformation. Into this
Dead Sea of lethargy and formalism Mr. Wilkinson
burst like a gunboat. He scattered his fire left
and right, aimed high and aimed low, blazed and
bombarded without fear or favour; sent some
crafts to the bottom, set fire to others, and covered
the sea with wreckage. In less metaphorical language,
he rebuked the sins of all and sundry, from
Duchesses to scullery-maids, Premiers to pageboys,
octogenarian rakes to damsels in their teens.
Then, as now, Society loved to be scolded, and
the more Mr. Wilkinson thundered the more it
crowded to his feet. "Pay your bills." "Get up
when you are called." "Don't stay till three at a
ball and then say that you are too delicate for
early services." "Eat one dinner a day instead
of three, and try to earn that one." "Give up
champagne for the season, and what you save on
your wine-merchant's bill send to the Mission
Field." "You are sixty-five years old and have
not been confirmed. Never too late to mend.
Join a Confirmation Class at once, and try to
remedy, by good example now, all the harm you
have done your servants or your neighbours by
fifty years' indifference." "Sell that diamond
cross which you carry with you into the sin-polluted
atmosphere of the Opera, give the proceeds
to feed the poor, and wear the only real
cross&mdash;the cross of self-discipline and self-denial."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>These are echoes&mdash;faint, indeed, but not, I think,
unfaithful&mdash;of thirty years ago, and they have
suddenly been awoke from their long slumber by
the sermons which Father Vaughan has just been
preaching at the Jesuits' Church in Farm Street,
Mayfair. The good Father, exalting his own
church, perhaps a little unduly, at the expense of
the Anglican churches in the district, observed
complacently that "Farm Street, in spite of its
extension, was all too small" for its congregation.
For my own part, I do not belong to that fold,
and I never wander to strange churches for the
pleasure of having my ears tickled; so I only know
Father Vaughan's utterances as they reach me
through the newspapers. A report in the third
person always tends to enfeeble rhetoric; but, in
spite of that hindrance, Father Vaughan's style
seems to lack nothing in the way of emphasis or
directness. Here is a fragment of his sermon
preached on Sunday the 10th of June 1906:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was no easy task for the votaries of pleasure
when Sunday came round to all of a sudden forget
their class distinctions, their privileged sets, their
social successes, their worldly goods, and to remember
that they were going into the presence of
Him before whom man and woman were not what
they happened to have, but what they happened to
be&mdash;that the debutante beauty might be before
God less than her maid who waited up half the
night for her, nay, less than the meanest scullery-maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

below stairs; while the millionaire with means
to buy up whole countries might be in God's sight
far less pleasing and very much more guilty than
the lowest groom in his stable yard."</p>

<p>Not less vigorous was the allocution of June 17.</p>

<p>"If Dives, who was buried in Hell, were to
revisit the earth he would most surely have the
<i>entrée</i> to London's smartest set to-day. He would
be literally pelted with invitations. And why not?
Dives, so well groomed and turned out, with such
a well-lined larder and so well-stocked a cellar,
would be the very ideal host to cultivate. He
would 'do you so well,' you would meet the 'right
people at his place,' and you could always bring
your 'latest friend.' Besides, what a good time
one would have at his house-parties, where there
would be no fear of being bored or dull!"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>And yet again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was well when the winning-card fell into
their hands, for then there was just a chance of
some dressmaker or tradesman being paid something
on account before becoming bankrupt. With
such examples of the misuse of wealth before
their eyes, it was a wonder there were not more
Socialists than there actually were."</p>

<p>All the memories of my youth have been revived
by Father Vaughan. Instead of 1906,
1876; instead of the Gothic gloom of Farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Street, the tawdry glare of St. Peter's, Eaton
Square; instead of a Jesuit Father in the pulpit,
a vigorous Protestant who renounces the Pope
and all his works and glories in the Anglicanism
of the Church of England. Grant those
differences, which after all are more incidental
than essential, and the sermons exactly reproduce
those stirring days when the present Bishop of
St. Andrews "shook the arsenal" of fashion,
"thundered over" London, and achieved, as his
admirers said, the supreme distinction of spoiling
the London Season.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the Higher Critics of a
later age, collating the Wilkinsonian tradition with
such fragments as remain of Father Vaughan's
discourses, will come to the conclusion that
"Wilkinson" never existed (except in Wordsworth's
ode to the Spade), but was a kind of heroic
figure conceived by a much later generation, which
had quivered under the rhetoric of a real person
or persons called Vaughan; and the opinion of
the learned will be sharply divided on such
questions as whether Vaughan was one or many;
if one, whether he was a Priest, a Cardinal, a
Head Master, or an Independent Minister; or
whether he was all four at different stages of his
career.</p>

Drumming her old ones forth from town,</p>
<p class="pin4">Know you the secret none discover?</p>
<p class="pin8">Tell it&mdash;when <i>you</i> go down."</p>

<p class="pn1">What Matthew Arnold did for the interpretation
of Oxford through the medium of prose, that Mr.
Quiller-Couch has done through the medium of
verse. In the poem from which I have just quoted
two stanzas he conveys, as no one else has ever
conveyed it in poetry, the tender and elusive charm
of that incomparable place.</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Know you her secret none can utter&mdash;<br />
Hers of the Book, the tripled Crown?"</p>

<p class="pn1">It is a hard question, and susceptible of some very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
prosaic and therefore inappropriate answers. The
true answer can, I think, only be given by those
for whom Oxford lies, half hid, in the enchanted
past: "Tell it&mdash;when <i>you</i> go down."</p>

<p>Some parts of the spell which Oxford exercises
on those who are subjected to her influence are in
no sense secret. We perceive them from the day
when we first set foot within her precincts, and
the sense of them abides with us for ever.</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"If less insensible than sodden clay<br />
In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,"</p>

<p class="pn1">all sons of Oxford must realize her material beauty,
her historical pre-eminence, her contribution to
thought and culture, her influence on the religious
life of England.</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Ah, but her secret? You, young lover."</p>

<p class="pn1">There is nothing secret about all this; it is palpable
and manifest; and yet it does not exhaust
the spell. Something there is that remains undiscovered,
or at best half-discovered&mdash;felt and
guessed at, but not clearly apprehended&mdash;until we
have passed away from the "dreaming spires"&mdash;the
cloisters and the gardens and the river&mdash;to
that sterner life for which these mysterious enchantments
have been preparing us.</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Know you the secret none discover?"</p>

<p class="pn1">If you do, that is proof that time has done its work
and has brought to the test of practical result the
influences which were shaping your mind and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
still more potently, your heart, between eighteen
and twenty-two. What that "secret" is, let an
unworthy son of Oxford try to tell.</p>

<p>To begin with a negative, it is not the secret of
Nirvana. There are misguided critics abroad in
the land who seem to assume that life lived easily
in a beautiful place, amid a society which includes
all knowledge in its comprehensive survey, and far
remote from the human tragedy of poverty and
toil and pain, must necessarily be calm. And so,
as regards the actual work and warfare of mankind,
it may be. The bitter cry of starving Poplar
does not very readily penetrate to the well-spread
table of an Oxford common-room. In a laburnum-clad
villa in the Parks we can afford to
reason very temperately about life in cities where
five families camp in one room. But when we
leave the actualities of life and come to the region
of thought and opinion, all the pent energy of
Oxford seethes and stirs. The Hebrew word for
"Prophet" comes, I believe, from a root which
signifies to bubble like water on the flames; and
in this fervency of thought and feeling Oxford is
characteristically prophetic. It is a tradition that
in some year of the passion-torn 'forties the subject
for the Newdigate Prize Poem was Cromwell,
whereas the subject for the corresponding poem at
Cambridge was Plato. In that selection Oxford
was true to herself. For a century at least (even
if we leave out of sight her earlier convulsions) she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
has been the battle-field of contending sects. Her
air has resounded with party-cries, and the dead
bodies of the controversially slain have lain thick
in her streets. All the opposing forces of Church
and State, of theology and politics, of philosophy
and science, of literary and social and economic
theory, have contended for mastery in the place
which Matthew Arnold, with rare irony, described
as "so unruffled by the fierce intellectual life of our
century, so serene!" Every succeeding generation
of Oxford men has borne its part in these ever-recurring
strifes. To hold aloof from them would
have been poltroonery. Passionately convinced
(at twenty) that we had sworn ourselves for life to
each cause which we espoused, we have pleaded
and planned and denounced and persuaded; have
struck the shrewdest blows which our strength
could compass, and devised the most dangerous
pitfalls which wit could suggest. Nothing came
of it all, and nothing could come, except the ruin
of our appointed studies and the resulting dislocation
of all subsequent life. But we were obeying
the irresistible impulse of the time and the place in
which our lot was cast, and we were ready to risk
our all upon the venture.</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"Never we wince, though none deplore us,<br />
We who go reaping that we sowed;</p>
<p class="pin4">Cities at cockcrow wake before us&mdash;<br />
Hey, for the lilt of the London road!</p>
<p class="pin4">One look back, and a rousing chorus!</p>
<p class="pin8">Never a palinode!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It is when we have finally sung that chorus and
have travelled a few miles upon that road, that we
learn the secret which we never discovered while
as yet Oxford held us in the thick of the fight.
We thought then that we were the most desperate
partizans; we asked no quarter, and gave none;
pushed our argumentative victories to their uttermost
consequences, and made short work of a
fallen foe. But, when all the old battle-cries have
died out of our ears, we begin to perceive humaner
voices. All at once we realize that a great part of
our old contentions was only sound and fury and
self-deception, and that, though the causes for
which we strove may have been absolutely right,
our opponents were not necessarily villains. In a
word, we have learnt the Secret of Oxford. All
the time that we were fighting and fuming, the
higher and subtler influences of the place were
moulding us, unconscious though we were, to a
more gracious ideal. We had really learnt to
distinguish between intellectual error and moral
obliquity. We could differ from another on every
point of the political and theological compass,
and yet in our hearts acknowledge him to be
the best of all good fellows. Without surrendering
a single conviction, we came to see
the virtue of so stating our beliefs as to persuade
and propitiate, instead of offending and
alienating. We had attained to that temper
which, in the sphere of thought and opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is analogous to the crowning virtue of Christian
charity.</p>

<p class="pin8 p1">"Tell it&mdash;when <i>you</i> go down."</p>

<p class="p1">Lately it has been my privilege to address a
considerable gathering of Oxford undergraduates,
all keenly alive to the interests and controversies
of the present hour, all devotedly loyal to the
tradition of Oxford as each understood it, and all
with their eyes eagerly fixed on "the wistful limit
of the world." With such an audience it was
inevitable to insist on the graces and benedictions
which Oxford can confer, and to dwell on Mr.
Gladstone's dogma that to call a man a "typically
Oxford man" is to bestow the highest possible
praise.</p>

<p>But this was not all. Something more remained
to be said. It was for a speaker who had
travelled for thirty years on "the London road"
to state as plainly as he could his own deepest
obligation to the place which had decided the
course and complexion of his life. And, when
it was difficult to express that obligation in the
pedestrian prose of an after-dinner speech, he
turned for succour to the poet who sang of "the
secret none discover." Wherever philosophical
insight is combined with literary genius and
personal charm, one says instinctively, "That man
is, or ought to be, an Oxford man." Chiefest
among the great names which Oxford ought to
claim but cannot is the name of Edmund Burke;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and the "Secret" on which we have been discoursing
seems to be conveyed with luminous precision
in his description of the ideal character: "It is
our business ... to bring the dispositions that
are lovely in private life into the service and
conduct of the commonwealth; so to be patriots
as not to forget we are gentlemen; to cultivate
friendships and to incur enmities; to have both
strong, but both selected&mdash;in the one to be
placable, in the other immovable." Whoso has
attained to that ideal has learnt the "Secret" of
Oxford.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">SCHOOLS FOR SHEPHERDS</p>

<p class="pc reduct">"The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed."</p>

<p class="p1">Why not? Because the Shepherds are so imperfectly
trained for their business. This, at any
rate, is the testimony of a Canon (sometime
Examining Chaplain to a Bishop) who at the
Diocesan Conference at Ely the other day declared
that the clergy were "not qualified to provide
instruction in Church Doctrine for the laity
because they were not properly trained"; and
further testified that "Nonconformist Ministers
were much better trained" than the English
Clergy. This testimony from a superior Shepherd
is rather startling for the Sheep, and it suggests
some interesting comparisons. It is, I take it,
unquestionable that Nonconformist ministers and
Roman Catholic priests alike have much more of
a technical education than is thought necessary
for their Anglican brothers. They are, so to say,
caught early, and their studies from seventeen or
eighteen onwards are directed steadily towards
their appointed work in life. A Roman Seminarist
learns his Latin and Greek as subsidiary to higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
studies; he spends, I believe, two years in Philosophy
and four in Theology, and is harassed by
incessant examinations. The training of the youth
who aspires to the Nonconformist ministry is of
much the same kind. "Moral Theology," in
other words the Science of the Confessional, he
naturally does not learn; but, on the other hand,
he is sedulously trained for the work of public
speaking and preaching. "If you can't preach,"
said Spurgeon to his students at Stockwell, "it is
a clear proof that God doesn't mean you to be
a preacher, and you must choose some other
occupation."</p>

<p>Vastly different is the training of the English
Curate. Private School, Public School, and
University: cricket, football, rowing: elementary
Greek and Latin, and a smattering of Law or
History&mdash;these constitute his "atmosphere," his
moral and mental discipline, between the ages of
ten and twenty-three. Even more remarkable is
his theological equipment. In ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred, he knows absolutely nothing
about the Church of which he is to be a minister,
her doctrines, history, or practical system. He
has been enveloped from his youth up by a hazy
atmosphere of Undogmatic Religion. I well remember
that an Undergraduate friend of mine,
who came to Oxford from Dr. Temple's Sixth
Form at Rugby, declined to believe that there
are two Sacraments. That there was a religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ceremony called "The Sacrament," for which
some people stayed after the ordinary service,
he was well aware, as also that infants were
ceremonially sprinkled; but that this latter ceremony
was a Sacrament he could not be induced
to believe. During his last year at Oxford he
informed himself better on this and some similar
topics, and a year afterwards was preaching, with
great acceptance, to a fashionable congregation.
From what I knew of my friend's theological
attainments, I should imagine that the Bishop's
Examination could not have been a very terrifying
process; but forty years earlier it must have been
even less formidable. The Hon. and Rev. George
Spencer (uncle of the present Lord Spencer) was
destined from an early age for the Family Living
in Northamptonshire. He hunted and shot, and
danced, and travelled on the Continent, and held
a commission in the Yeomanry. After two years
at Trinity College, Cambridge, he took a "Nobleman's
Degree," and, when he neared the canonical
age of twenty-three, he wrote to the Bishop of
Peterborough's Examining Chaplain offering himself
for Ordination and asking advice as to his
preparation. The examiner&mdash;ah, would that there
were more like him!&mdash;wrote back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is impossible that I should ever entertain
any idea of subjecting a gentleman with whose
talents and good qualities I am so well acquainted
as I am with yours to any examination except as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a matter of form, for which a verse in the Greek
Testament and an Article of the Church of England
returned into Latin will be amply sufficient."</p>

<p>This reassuring letter was written on the 12th
of October 1822, and on the 22nd of December
next ensuing George Spencer was ordained Deacon
and a year later Priest. "On the evening before
the ordination, whilst the Bishop and various
clergymen and their ladies and the candidates
amused themselves with a rubber of whist, Mr.
Spencer refused to play." And the refusal was
considered, as perhaps it was, noteworthy.</p>

<p>The Movement which issued from Oxford in
1833 introduced some improvement into the
method of conducting ordinations, as into other
departments of the Church's work. The examination
became, though not yet very serious, at
least a little less farcical, and some attempt was
made in charges and sermons to urge upon the
candidates the gravity of what they were undertaking.
But, according to the late Bishop Woodford,
"the evenings, during which they were left
to themselves, became evenings of social enjoyment,
if not of boisterous merriment, in which the
features of an old college supper-party were reproduced,
rather than intervals of solemn thought
and retirement."</p>

<p>Bishop Samuel Wilberforce raised the standard
of what was expected in the way of Scriptural
and theological knowledge; he made the examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a reality; he laid special stress on sermon-writing;
and he made the Ember Week a season
of spiritual retirement in which men about to take
the most decisive step in life might be brought
face to face with the responsibilities involved in
their decision. The example set by Wilberforce
was followed, sooner or later, by every bishop on
the bench; the requirements have been raised, and
the system has been developed and improved;
but the credit of initiation belongs to that epoch-making
episcopate, which began in 1845 and
ended, through a false step made by a horse on
the Surrey Downs, on the 19th of July 1873.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent to those who had the
spiritual interests of the Church at heart that
something more than twelve months' book-work
and a week of religious retirement was required to
wean the ordinary B.A. from the puerilities&mdash;if
nothing worse&mdash;of his Undergraduate life, and to
equip him for a life of Pastorship and Teachership.
The sense of this need gave rise to the creation
of Theological Colleges, where a man who looked
forward to Holy Orders might, after taking his
ordinary degree at Oxford or Cambridge, apply
himself to the studies more specially necessary for
his chosen work, and&mdash;even more important still&mdash;might
acquire the habits of methodical and self-disciplined
life. The idea took shape in such
foundations as the Theological Colleges of Wells,
Cuddesdon, Sarum, and Ely, the <i>Scholæ Cancellarii</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at Lincoln, and the Clergy School at Leeds.
Fighting their way through all manner of strange
misrepresentations about Monasticism and Mediævalism,
they have in the course of years attained
to recognition, popularity, and apparent stability.
The bishops patronize them warmly, and incumbents
who desire curates not wholly ignorant of
their craft are increasingly unwilling to engage one
who has not passed through a Theological College.
That the broad result of the training given in
these seminaries is a general increase in clerical
efficiency I cannot doubt, but perhaps a layman
may be permitted to point out some curious gaps
and lapses in that training which go some way
towards making clergymen less esteemed, and
therefore less influential, than they ought to be.</p>

<p>1. The Clergy are not taught to be courteous.
If they are courteous by nature and habit, well
and good; but a rough Undergraduate, destitute
of sympathy and tact and ignorant of social usage,
passes through a Theological College and comes
out as rough as he entered it. A Bear in Holy
Orders is as destructive as a Bull in a China
Shop.</p>

<p>2. The Clergy are not taught to manage money;
they muddle their public accounts; they beg
money for one object and use it for another; they
seldom acknowledge what they receive by post;
and they have absolutely no notion of cutting
their coat according to their cloth. "Spend and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
beg, and the money will come from somewhere"
is their simple and sufficient creed.</p>

<p>3. The Clergy are not taught business. They
have not the faintest notion of conducting a public
meeting. They lose their way in the agenda-paper
of the most insignificant committee. They break
appointments at their will and pleasure. They
seldom answer letters, and are frankly astonished
when their correspondents are annoyed.</p>

<p>4. The Clergy are not taught the Science of
Citizenship. Outside their strictly professional
studies (and, in some cases, the records of athleticism)
they are the most ignorant set of young
men in the world. They work hard and play
hard, but they never read. They know nothing
of books, nothing of history, nothing of the Constitution
under which they live, of the principles
and records of political parties, of the need for
social reform or the means of securing it. They
have a vague but clinging notion that Radicals are
Infidels, and that Dissenters, if they got their
deserts, would have their heads punched.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago an Italian critic said that, in
spite of all their defects, the English clergy were
"Un clero colto e civile." Could as much be said
to-day?</p>

<h2 class="pc4">XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">PILGRIMAGES</p>

<p>I use the word in something wider than Chaucer's
sense, and yet in a sense not wholly different from
his. For, though we no longer make an annual
visit to the Shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury,
still we all feel bound, at least once a year, to go
somewhere and do something quite out of our
normal course. Perhaps, like Chaucer's friends,
we "long" to do this in April, but the claims of
business are generally too strong for us; so we
have to content ourselves with admiring the peeps
of greenery which begin to invade the soot of
our urban gardens, and, if we are of a cultured
habit, we can always quote Browning's Thrush or
strain the kalendar so as to admit Wordsworth's
Daffodils.</p>

<p>This notion of a yearly Pilgrimage as a necessity
of rightly-ordered life seems to have fallen into
a long abeyance. "Dan Chaucer" (for I love to
be on easy terms with great men) described the
social customs of the fourteenth century, and then
the Pilgrimage seems to have been an established
institution: "Tom Hughes" described those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the eighteenth, and this is what, writing in 1862,
he says about the annual Pilgrimages of his own
time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been credibly informed, and am inclined
to believe, that the various Boards of Directors of
Railway Companies agreed together some ten years
back to buy up the learned profession of Medicine,
body and soul. To this end they set apart several
millions of money, which they continually distribute
judiciously among the Doctors, stipulating
only this one thing&mdash;that they shall prescribe
change of air to every patient who can pay, or
borrow money to pay, a railway fare, and see
their prescription carried out. If it be not for
this, why is it that none of us can be well at
home for a year together? It wasn't so twenty
years ago&mdash;not a bit of it. The Browns did not
go out of the county once in five years."</p>

<p>The Browns, as we all know, stood in Mr.
Hughes's vocabulary for the Upper Middle Class
of England&mdash;the class to which the clergy, the
smaller squires, and the professional men belong;
the class which in Chaucer's time contained the
"Man of Lawe," the "Marchande," the "Franklyne,"
and the "Doctore of Phisyke"; and,
although Mr. Hughes, who ought to know, says
that in the earlier part of Queen Victoria's reign
they were a stay-at-home class, they are now the
most regular and the most zealous of Pilgrims.
It was the majestic misfortune of the Duke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
"Lothair" to have so many houses that he had
no home. People so circumstanced do not need
to go on Pilgrimages. After the autumn in a
Scotch Castle, the winter in a country house in the
Midlands, the spring in another in the Southern
Counties, and the season in Grosvenor Square,
people are glad of a little rest, and seek it in
some "proud alcove" on the Thames or a sea-girt
villa at Cowes. Unless their livers drive them
to Carlsbad or their hearts to Nauheim, they do
not travel, but display what Lord Beaconsfield
called "the sustained splendour of their stately
lives" in the many mansions which, in the aggregate,
represent to them the idea of Home. I
might perhaps on another occasion sketch the
Grand Tour of Europe, on which, for educational
purposes, the Earl of Fitzurse used to send his
eldest son, young Lord Cubley; compressed, with
his tutor and doctor, into a travelling-carriage,
with a valet and a courier in the rumble. The
Duke of Argyll's Autobiography has just told us
what this kind of Pilgrimage was like; but to-day
I am dealing with the present rather than the past.</p>

<p>It is the people with one house who go on
Pilgrimages nowadays&mdash;the impoverished squire,
the smoke-dried clergyman, the exhausted merchant,
the harried editor. To these must be added
all the inhabitants, male and female, of Lodging-land
and Flat-land,&mdash;all "the dim, common
populations" of Stuccovia and Suburbia. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
are mysterious laws of association which connect
classes with localities. Tradesmen love Margate;
to clerks Scarborough is dear. The Semitic
financier has long claimed Brighton for his own.
Costermongers go hop-picking in Kent; artizans
disport themselves on the nigger-haunted pier of
Southend. Governed by some mysterious law of
their being, schoolmasters make straight for the
Alps. There they live the strenuous life and brave
the perilous ascent; climb and puff and pant all
day; rush in, very untidy and not very clean, to
<i>table d'hôte</i>; and season their meal with the "shop"
of St. Winifred's or the gay banter of Rosslyn
Common-room. It is agreeable to watch the
forced cordiality, the thin tutorial humour, with
which they greet some quite irresponsive pupil
who happens to have strayed into the same hotel;
and I have often had occasion to admire the precocious
dexterity with which the pupil extricates
himself from this dreaded companionship. Of
Mr. Gladstone it was said by his detractors that he
had something of the Schoolmaster in his composition;
and this trait was aptly illustrated when,
during the summer holidays some fifty years ago,
he met the late Duchess of Abercorn in a country
house accompanied by her schoolboy son, Lord
George Hamilton. Not many mornings had
elapsed before Mr. Gladstone said to the boy's
mother, "Duchess, don't you think it a pity that
your son should spend his holidays in entire idleness?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
I should be happy to give him an hour's
Homer every morning." The offer was accepted,
and the foundation of Lord George's lifelong
hostility to the Liberal leader was securely laid.
It is the nervous dread of some such awful possibility
which supplies wings to the boy's feet and
lies to his tongue when he encounters Dr. Grimstone
or Basil Warde in a Swiss hotel.</p>

<p>While the Schoolmaster limits his aspirations to
the Alps, the Oxford or Cambridge Don, having a
longer vacation at his command, takes a more
extended view, and urges his adventurous Pilgrimage
along roads less trite. A few years ago an
Oxford Don resolved to strike out what was then a
quite new line, and spend his Long Vacation in
Portugal. Conscious of insufficient acquaintance
with the Portuguese language, he repaired to Mr.
Parker's excellent shop in the Turl and enquired
for a Portuguese Phrase-book. After some research,
that never-failing bookseller produced "The
New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and
English." The book had an instant and a deserved
success. The preface sets forth that "a choice of
familiar dialogues, clean of gallicisms and despoiled
phrases, it was missing yet to studious Portuguese
and Brazilian youth; and also to persons of other
nations that wish to know the Portuguese language."
To supply this felt want Pedro Carolino
compiled his hand-book for "the acceptation of
the studious persons, and especially of the Youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
at which we dedicate him particularly." Among
those studious persons was our Pilgrim-Don, who
naturally turned in the first instance to a dialogue
headed</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">"FOR TO TRAVEL</p>

<p class="p1">When do you start?</p>

<p>As soon as I shall have to finish a business at
Cadiz.</p>

<p>Have you already arrested a coach?</p>

<p>That seems to me a little dear."</p>

<p class="p2">The next dialogue follows in the natural
order:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">"FOR TO BREAKFAST</p>

<p class="p2">A day of sight-seeing concludes happily with
the ever-welcome dialogue&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">Parsimony is a bond which makes the whole
world kin, and it is interesting to find embedded
in 182 closely-printed pages of "despoiled
phrases" two such characteristic specimens of
sound English as "That seems to me a little dear"
and "Don't forget the waiter."</p>

<h2 class="p4">XV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Dr. Blimber to his pupils on
the eve of the holidays, "we will resume our
studies on the twenty-fifth of next month." But
that adjournment, I think, was for Christmas, and
we are now in what Matthew Arnold's delicious
schoolboy called "the glad season of sun and
flowers." Very soon, in Dr. Farrar's romantic
phrase, "the young life which usually plays like
the sunshine over St. Winifred's will be pouring
unwonted brightness into many happy English
homes." Or, to take Mr. Snawley's darker view
of the same event, we shall be in the thick of one
of "those ill-judged comings home twice a year
that unsettle children's minds so."</p>

<p>The associations of the moment, so different in
their effects on different natures, have awoke the
spirit of prophecy in the late Head Master of
Eton, Dr. Warre, who, projecting his soul into
futurity, sees dark days coming for the "Public
Schools" as that phrase has been hitherto understood.
It was clear, said Dr. Warre, after distributing
the prizes at Shrewsbury, "that ere long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the Public Schools would have to justify not
only their <i>curriculum</i>, but, it might be, their very
existence. The spirit of the age seemed to be
inclined towards Utilitarianism, and it was now
tending to undervalue the humanities and the
culture that attended them, and to demand what
it appreciated as a useful and practical training&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
something capable of making boys breadwinners
as soon as they left school. He did not
say that view would ultimately prevail, but the
trend of public opinion in that direction would
necessitate on the part of Public Schools a period
of self-criticism, and very probably a reorganization
of <i>curricula</i>. But there was another problem
to be faced which would become more serious as
the century waxed older, and that was a new
phase of competition. As secondary education
expanded, secondary day-schools would be provided
regardless of expense, and it was idle to
think this would have no effect upon great Public
Schools. What would be weighed in the balance,
however, was the value of the corporate life and
aggregate influence of the Public Schools upon
the formation of character."</p>

<p>When ex-Head Masters begin to see visions
and Old Etonians to dream dreams, the ordinary
citizen, with his traditional belief in the virtue
and permanence of Public Schools, must rub his
eyes in astonishment. What is going to happen
next? Is Eton to abandon "taste" and take to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
"useful knowledge"? Is Harrow to close its
Boarding Houses and become a village Day School
once more? Are Wykeham's "seventy faithful
boys" (as the late Lord Selborne called them in
his first attempt at verse) no longer to "tund" or
be "tunded"? Is Westminster to forswear its
Latin Play, and replace the "Phormio" and the
"Trinummus" with "Box and Cox" and "Ici on
Parle Français"?</p>

<p>These enquiries, and others like them, are forced
on our attention by such subversive discourse as
Dr. Warre's; and that incursion of rampant boyhood
which begins with the beginning of August
reinforces the eloquence of the ex-Head Master.
The Retreat of the Ten Thousand, which used to
worry us in our youth, was not half so formidable
an affair as the Advance of the Ten Thousand,
schoolboys though they be, who just now overrun
the land. There they are, an army ever increasing
in numbers and maintained at an immense
expense. Whatever commercial and agricultural
depression may have effected in other quarters,
it did not touch the schools of England. The
greater schools are full to overflowing; provincial
schools have doubled and trebled their numbers;
and every Elizabethan and Edwardian foundation
in the Kingdom has woke from slumber
and celebrated at least a Tercentenary. And all
this is not done for nothing. Private schoolmasters
take shootings in Scotland; the proprietors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of Boarding-houses at the Public Schools
buy villas in the Riviera, and build pineries and
vineries at home; meanwhile the British Parent
eyes his diminishing income and his increasing
rates, and asks himself, in the secrecy of his own
heart, what Tommy is really getting in return for
the £200 a year expended on his education. The
answer takes various forms. Perhaps Tommy is
following the "grand, old fortifying classical curriculum"
which sufficed for Lord Lumpington,
and enabled the Rev. Esau Hittall to compose his
celebrated "Longs and Shorts on the Calydonian
Boar." In this case the parent says, with Rawdon
Crawley, "Stick to it, my boy; there's nothing
like a good classical education&mdash;nothing," but he
generally is too diffident about his own accomplishments
to subject his sons to a very searching
test. Perhaps one boy in a hundred learns
enough Latin and Greek at school to fit him for
a good place in the Classical Tripos or a "First
in Mods." This, if he is meant to be a schoolmaster,
is a definite and tangible result from his
father's investment; if he is intended for any
other profession the advantage is not so clear.
If he is to be a Soldier, no doubt there is the
"Army Class" or the "Modern School," where,
indeed, he is exempted from Greek, is taught some
mathematics, and acquires some very English
French and German; but, in spite of these privileges,
he generally requires a year's residence at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
crammer's before he has a chance for Sandhurst.
For the ordinary life of the Professions the Public
School makes no preparation whatever. Tommy
may have acquired "taste," but he is no more
qualified to be, as Dr. Warre says, a "bread-winner"
than he was the day he began school-life.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold, in his delightful essay on "An
Eton Boy," says, with regard to that boy's prowess
as Master of the Beagles:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The aged Barbarian will, upon this, admiringly
mumble to us his story how the Battle of
Waterloo was won in the Playing Fields of Eton.
Alas! disasters have been prepared in those Playing
Fields as well as victories&mdash;disasters due to an
inadequate mental training, to want of application,
knowledge, intelligence, lucidity."</p>

<p>With "taste" we commonly hear "tone" combined
in the eulogies of Public Schools. The
Parent, who knows (though he would not for the
world admit) that Tommy has learnt nothing at
St. Winifred's or Rosslyn which will ever enable
him to earn a penny, falls back upon the impalpable
consolation that there is "a very nice tone about
the school." Certainly Eton imparts manners to
those who have not acquired them at home, and
in this respect Radley is like unto it. But, taking
the Public Schools as a whole, it can scarcely be
denied that, however faithfully they cultivate the
ingenuous arts, they suffer Youth to be extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
brutal. If this be urged, the Parent will shift his
ground and say, "Well, I like boys to be natural.
I don't wish my son to be a Lord Chesterfield.
Character is everything. It is the religious and
moral influence of a Public School that I think so
valuable." As to the Religion taught in Public
Schools, it is, as Mr. T. E. Page of Charterhouse
recently said with artless candour, exactly the
same commodity as will probably be offered by
the County Councils when the Education Bill has
become law; and it is worth noting that, though
Bishops shrink with horror at the prospect of this
religion being offered to the poor, they are perfectly
content that it should be crammed down
the throats of their own sons. As to the morality
acquired at Public Schools, a clergyman who was
successively an Eton boy and an Eton master
wrote twenty-five years ago: "The masters of many
schools are sitting on a volcano, which, when it
explodes, will fill with horror and alarm those who
do not know what boys' schools are, or knowing
it, shut their eyes and stop their ears." It must be
admitted that the British Parent, dwelling on the
slopes of that volcano, regards its chronic menace
and its periodical activities with the most singular
composure.</p>

<p>In years gone by Harrow, like most other places
where there was a Public School accessible to day
boys, was a favourite resort of widowed ladies
whose husbands had served in the Indian Army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
or Civil Service. These "Indian Widows," as he
called them, so pestered Dr. Vaughan, then Head
Master, that he said in the bitterness of his soul:
"Before I came to Harrow I thought 'Suttee' an
abomination; but now I see that there is a great
deal to be said for it." It is easy enough to see
why Head Masters dislike the Home Boarding
system. It defeats the curious policy by which
assistant masters pay themselves out of their
boarders' stomachs, and it brings all the arrangements
of teaching and discipline under the survey,
and perhaps criticism, of the parents; but, in spite
of magisterial objections, the Home Boarding system
is probably the only and certainly the most
efficacious method of coping with those moral
evils which all schoolmasters not wilfully blind
acknowledge, and which the best of them strenuously
combat. In that extension of Day Schools
which Dr. Warre foresees lies the best hope of a
higher tone in public education.</p>

<p>The British Parent knows the weaknesses of the
Public School system. He knows that he gets a
very doubtful return for his money&mdash;that his son
learns nothing useful and very little that is ornamental;
is unsuitably fed, and, when ill, insufficiently
attended; exposed to moral risks of a very
grave type; and withdrawn at the most impressible
season of life from the sanctifying influences of
Motherhood and Home. He knows all this, and,
knowing it, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
he sends all his boys to a Public School. Why?
Partly because every one goes to a Public School
and he has no wish to be eccentric or faddish;
partly because the boys are tiresome at home and
he wants peace; partly because, in existing conditions,
he does not know how to get them educated
while they are under his roof. But the
strongest reason is none of these. He sends his
sons to Eton or Harrow because he was there
himself, has felt the glamour and learnt the spell;
because some of his happiest memories hover
round the Playing Fields or the Hill; because
there he first knew what Friendship meant and
first tasted the Romance of Life.</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"I may have failed, my School may fail;<br />
I tremble, but thus much I dare:</p>
<p class="pin4">I love her. Let the critics rail,<br />
My brethren and my home are there."</p>

<h2 class="p4">XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">SCHOOLS AND BOARDING-HOUSES</p>

<p>"Any two meals at a Boarding-House are together
less than one square meal." This pleasing
postulate was, I believe, in the first instance
evolved from the bitter experience of a hungry
mathematician who, at this season of the year,
sought change of air and scene at Margate or
Herne Bay. But to-day I use the word "Boarding-House"
in that more restricted sense which
signifies a Master's house for the accommodation
of boys at a Public School. My reason for discussing
the subject is that a stray sentence in
my last chapter, about the profits derived from
such Boarding-Houses, caused dire offence. I
am the most docile creature alive, and the rebukes
which I have incurred caused me, as the
French say, to make a return upon myself. I
subjected my conscience to severe cross-examination.
I asked whether what I had written was
wholly or even approximately true, or entirely
false; and whether, if true, it was offensive or
indelicate. Here is the sentence in all its unglossed
brutality: "The proprietors of Boarding-Houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
at the Public Schools buy villas in the
Riviera and build pineries and vineries at home."
Now, of course, a Schoolmaster is nothing if not
critical, and, in superintending the studies of his
young friends, he rightly insists on the most
scrupulous accuracy of phrase and figure. Not
for the construing boy is the plea, dear to Biblical
critics, that "the wider divergence is the higher
unity." The calculating boy must not, if he
values his peace, mistake inference for demonstration.
Woe betide the excuse-making boy if he
protests that he has spent an hour over his lesson
when his tutor can show that he could only have
spent fifty-five minutes. This Chinese exactness
is all very well in the schoolroom, but tends to
become a bore in the intercourse of social life.
An Assistant Master, stung into activity by my
recent strictures on Public Schools, has swooped
down upon me with all the fierce alacrity which
he would display in detecting a false quantity or
an erroneous deduction. "Villas in the Riviera!
Who buys Villas in the Riviera? Give, name,
date, and place by return of post, or&mdash;write out
five hundred lines." "What do you mean by
Pineries and Vineries? I and my colleagues at
St. Winifred's only grow cucumbers; and the
Composition-Master, though he has large private
means, gets his grapes from the Stores. Retract
and apologize, or be for ever fallen."</p>

<p>Now really, when I read all this virtuous indignation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
I am irresistibly reminded of the Bishop in
"Little Dorrit," who, when all the guests were extolling
Mr. Merdle's wealth, spoke pensively about
"the goods of this world," and "tried to look as
if he were rather poor himself." In vain I protested
that I meant no injurious allusion to Monte
Carlo, and proposed to substitute "Mansions in
the Isle of Wight" for "Villas in the Riviera."
The substitution availed me nothing. "You say
'Mansions.' Do you really know more than one?
And how do you know that the schoolmaster who
bought it did not marry a wife with a fortune?
You cannot investigate his marriage settlements,
so your illustration counts for nothing." In the
same conciliatory spirit, I urged that "Pineries and
Vineries" was a picturesque phrase invented by
Lord Randolph Churchill to describe the amenities
of a comfortable country house, not of the largest
order; but my pedagogue was not to be pacified.
"If you didn't mean Pineries and Vineries, you
shouldn't have said so. It creates a bad impression
in the parents' minds. Of course no reasonable
person could object to one's having gardens,
or stabling, or a moderate shooting, or a share of
a salmon river; but parents don't like the notion
that we are living in luxury. They have a nasty
way of contrasting it with the nonsense which
their boys tell them about tough meat and rancid
butter."</p>

<p>At this point I began to see some resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
between my correspondent and Matthew Arnold's
critic in the <i>Quarterly</i> of October 1868&mdash;"one
of the Eton Under-Masters, who, like Demetrius
the Silversmith, seems alarmed for the gains of his
occupation." For, in spite of all corrections and
deductions, I cannot help regarding Public Schoolmasters
as a well-paid race. Of course, it is true
that their incomes are not comparable to those of
successful barristers or surgeons, or even Ministers
of State; but, on the other side, their work is
infinitely easier; their earnings begin from the
day on which they embark on their profession;
and no revolution of the wheel of State can shake
them from their well-cushioned seats. I am quite
willing to admit that, on the figures supplied by
my correspondent, he and his colleagues at St.
Winifred's are not making so much money as their
predecessors made twenty or thirty years ago.
But, as far as I can understand, this diminution of
incomes does not arise from diminution of charges,
but only from the fact that the force of public
opinion has driven schoolmasters to recognize,
rather more fully than in days gone by, some
primary needs of boy-nature. When the Royal
Commission of 1862 was enquiring into the boarding
arrangements of a famous school, one of the
Commissioners was astonished to find that, in spite
of the liberal charge for board, the boys got
nothing but tea and bread and butter for breakfast.
Apparently wishing to let the masters down easy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
he suggested that perhaps eggs also were provided.
To this suggestion the witness's answer was monumental:
"Eggs, indeed, are not provided, but in
some houses a large machine for boiling eggs is
brought in every day; so that, if the boys bring
their eggs, they are boiled for them." Surely the
Master who first conceived this substitution of hardware
for food deserved a permanent place among
Social Economists; but "the bigots of this iron
time," though they may not actually "have called
his harmless art a crime," have resolved that,
when a father pays £200 a year for his boy's
schooling, the boy shall have something more
substantial than bread and butter for breakfast.
This reform alone, according to my correspondent,
knocked some hundreds a year off each House-Master's
income.</p>

<p>Then, again, as regards Sanitation. Here,
certainly not before it was wanted, reform has
made its appearance, and the injured House-Master
has had to put his hand in his pocket.
When I was at a Public School, in that Golden
Age of Profits to which my correspondent looked
back so wistfully, the sanitary arrangements were
such as to defy description and stagger belief.
In one Pupil-Room there was only the thickness
of the boarded floor between the cesspool and
the feet of the boys as they sat at lessons. In
my own house, containing forty boarders, there
were only two baths. In another, three and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
four boys were cooped together, by day as well
as by night, in what would, in an ordinary house,
be regarded as a smallish bedroom. Now all
this is changed. Drainage is reconstructed; baths
are multiplied; to each boy is secured a sufficient
air-space at lessons and in sleep. The Sanitary
Engineer is let loose every term&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"What pipes and air-shafts! What wild ecstasy!"</p>

<p class="pn1">But the "ecstasy" is confined to the bosom of the
Engineer as he draws up his little account, and the
House-Master moans, like Mr. Mantalini, over the
"Demnition Total."</p>

<p>Yet another such deduction must be borne in
mind. Volumes of nonsense have been written
about the Fagging System. Sentimental writers
have gushed over the beautiful relation which it
establishes between Fag-Master and Fag. Some,
greatly daring, have likened it to the relation
of elder and younger brothers. Others, more
historically minded, have tried to connect it with
the usages of Chivalry and the services rendered
by the Page to the Knight. As a matter of fact,
it was, as "Jacob Omnium," himself an Old
Etonian, pointed out fifty years ago, "an affair of
the breeches pocket." As long as younger boys
could be compelled (by whatever methods) to
clean lamps and brush clothes and toast sausages
and fill tubs for elder boys it was obvious that
fewer servants were required. One of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
brilliant Etonians now living has said that "to see
a little boy performing, with infinite pains and
hopeless inadequacy, the functions of a domestic
servant, might have moved Democritus to tears
and Heraclitus to laughter." That Fagging has
its uses, more especially in the case of spoilt boys
brought up in purse-proud homes, few Public
Schoolmen will deny; but the British Parent
tends increasingly to draw a distinction between
the duties of a fag and those of a footman; and
the wages-bill becomes an increasingly important
item in the House-Master's expenditure.</p>

<p>What, then, is the conclusion of the whole
matter? It is, as I have repeatedly said, that
a Boarding-School, whether public or private, is
not the ideal method of educating boys; but,
pending that great increase of Day-Schools for the
sons of the upper classes which Dr. Warre foresees,
it is the only method practically available for
the great majority of English parents. Whether
the instruction imparted in the Public Schools is
or is not worth the amount which it costs is a
matter of opinion; and, indeed, as long as the
parent (who, after all, has to pay) is satisfied,
no one else need trouble himself about the question.
As to domestic arrangements and provision
for health and comfort, it may be frankly conceded
that the Schoolboy of to-day is much better
off than his father or even his elder brother was;
and that the improvements in his lot have tended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to diminish the profits on which the House-Master
used to grow rich.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Having the terrors of the ferule before
my eyes, let me hasten to say, with all possible
explicitness, that in my account of my correspondence
with the outraged Schoolmaster, I have
aimed at giving a general impression rather than a
verbal transcript.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">SQUARES</p>

<p>All true lovers of Lewis Carroll will remember
that Hiawatha, when he went a-photographing,
"pulled and pushed the joints and hinges" of his
Camera,</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Till it looked all squares and oblongs,<br />
Like a complicated figure<br />
In the Second Book of Euclid."</p>

<p class="pn1">But it is not of squares in the mathematical sense
that I speak to-day, but rather of those enclosed
spaces, most irregularly shaped and proportioned,
which go by the name of "Squares" in London.</p>

<p>It is in sultry August that the value of these
spaces is most clearly perceived; for now the
better-disposed owners fling open the gates of
their squares and suffer them to become, at least
temporarily, the resting-places of the aged and
decrepit, and the playgrounds of the children.
To extend these benefits more widely and to secure
them in perpetuity are objects for which civic
reformers have long striven; and during the
present session of Parliament<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> (for, as Dryasdust
would remind us, Parliament is not prorogued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
but only adjourned) two Acts have been passed
which may do something at least towards attaining
the desired ends. One of these Acts provides
that, in cases where "Open Spaces and Burial
Grounds" are vested in Trustees, the Trustees
may transfer them to the Local Authorities, to be
maintained for the use and service of the public.
The other forbids for all time the erection of
buildings on certain squares and gardens which
belong to private owners, those owners having
consented to this curtailment of their powers.
The conjunction of "Burial Grounds" with "Open
Spaces" in the purview of the former Act has a
rather lugubrious sound; but in reality it points
to one of the happiest changes which recent years
have brought to London.</p>

<p>"A hemmed-in churchyard, pestiferous and obscene,
whence malignant diseases are communicated
to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters
who have not departed&mdash;here, in a beastly scrap
of ground which a Turk would reject as a savage
abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they
bring 'our dear brother here departed' to receive
Christian burial. With houses looking on, on
every side, save where a reeking little tunnel of a
court gives access to the iron gate&mdash;with every
villainy of life in action close on death and every
poisonous element of death in action close on life,&mdash;here
they lower our dear brother down a foot
or two; here sow him in corruption, to be raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in corruption; an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside;
a shameful testimony to future ages that
civilization and barbarism walked this boastful
island together."</p>

<p>When Dickens wrote that hideous description,
worthy to be illustrated by Hogarth in his most
realistic mood, he did not exaggerate&mdash;he could
not exaggerate&mdash;the obscenity of burial-grounds
in crowded cities. To-day they are green with
turf and bright with flowers, and brighter still
with the unconquerable merriment of childhood at
play among the dim memorials of the forgotten
dead. What is true of the particular spot which
Dickens described is true all over London; and
the resting-places of the departed have been made
oases of life and health in this arid wilderness of
struggling and stifled humanity.</p>

<p>Though so much has been done in the way
of making the Churchyards available for public
uses, comparatively little has been done with the
Squares; and philosophers of the school erroneously
called Cynical might account for this
difference by the fact that, whereas the churchyards
were generally in the hands of official
trustees, such as Rectors, Churchwardens, Overseers,
or Vestries, the principal squares of London
are the private property of individual owners.
Even the London Squares and Enclosures Act,
just passed, illustrates the same principle. The
preamble of the Act sets forth that in respect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
every Square or Enclosure with which it deals the
consent of the owner has been obtained. In each
case, therefore, the owner has consented to legislation
which will prevent himself or his successors
from building on what are now open spaces, and,
so far, each owner concerned has shown himself
a patriotic citizen and a well-wisher to posterity.
But, when we come to examine the schedule of
properties to which the Act applies, it is interesting
to compare the number belonging to private persons
with the number belonging to public bodies.
The Act applies to sixty-four properties; of these
fifty-five belong to public bodies such as District
Councils, Governors of Hospitals, and Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, and nine to private persons,
among whom it is pleasant to reckon one Liberal
M.P., Sir John Dickson-Poynder, and, by way of
balance, one Conservative peer, Lord Camden.</p>

<p>A further study of the Schedule reveals the
instructive fact that, with two exceptions in the
City of Westminster and one in the Borough of
Kensington, none of the scheduled properties lie
within areas which could by any stretch of terms
be called wealthy, fashionable, or aristocratic.
Public authorities in such districts as Camberwell
and Lewisham&mdash;private owners in Islington and
Woolwich&mdash;have willingly surrendered their rights
for the benefit of the community; but none of the
great ground landlords have followed suit. The
owners of Belgrave Square and Grosvenor Square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and Portman Square and Cavendish Square and
Berkeley Square&mdash;<i>the</i> Squares, <i>par excellence</i>, of
fashionable London&mdash;have kept their seigniorial
rights untouched. Pascal told us of some very
human but very unregenerate children who said
"This dog belongs to <i>me</i>," and "That place in the
sun is <i>Mine</i>," and Pascal's comment was, "Behold,
the beginning and the image of all usurpation
upon earth!" Similarly, the human but unregenerate
landowners of fashionable London say,
as they survey their possessions, "This Square
belongs to <i>me</i>," "That place in the shade is <i>Mine</i>,"
while the August sun beats down on the malodorous
street, and tottering paupers peer wistfully at
the benches under the plane trees, and street-boys
flatten their noses against the iron railings and
madly yearn for cricket-pitches so smooth and
green.</p>

<p>Although these fashionable Squares are so
sedulously guarded against the intrusion of outsiders,
they are very little used by those who have
the right of entrance. "Livery Servants and
Dogs not admitted" is a legendary inscription
which, in its substance, still operates. Here and
there a nurse with a baby in her arms haunts the
shade, or a parcel of older children play lawn-tennis
or croquet to an accompaniment of chaff
from envious street-boys. But, as a general rule,
for twenty hours out of the twenty-four and for
ten months out of the twelve the Squares are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
absolutely vacant; and one of the most reasonable
reforms which I could conceive would be to convert
them from private pleasure-grounds to public
gardens, and to throw the cost of maintaining
them in order and beauty on the London County
Council.</p>

<p>As I said before, some Square-owners have,
without waiting for legal compulsion, taken tentative
steps towards this reform. The Trustees of
Lincoln's Inn Fields, the largest and the shadiest
of all London Squares, have made them over to
the County Council, and, in the hot months of
declining summer, the juvenile populations of Holborn
and St. Giles play their breathless games
where Babington was hanged and Russell beheaded.
It was there that, on the 20th of July 1683, Sir
Ralph Verney, riding out from London to his
home in Buckinghamshire, "saw the scaffold
making ready against Lord Russell's execution to-morrow&mdash;God
help him, and save the country."</p>

<p>But if once we leave the utilities and amenities
of the London Squares and begin to meddle with
their antiquities, we shall soon overflow all reasonable
limits. Bloomsbury Square still reeks (at
least for those who know their "Barnaby Rudge")
with the blood which was shed in the Gordon
Riots. Grosvenor Square&mdash;the last district of
London which clung to oil-lamps in hopeless resistance
to the innovation of gas&mdash;embodies the
more recent memory of the Cato Street Conspiracy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
In Berkeley Square (from what is now
Lord Rosebery's house) Sarah Child eloped, and
annexed the name and the banking-house of Child
to the Earldom of Jersey. In Portman Square
Mrs. Montagu presided over her court of Bluestockings
and feasted the chimney-sweeps on
May-day. In Manchester Square, under the roof
which now houses the Wallace Collection, the
dazzling beauty of Isabella Lady Hertford stirred
the fatuous passion of George IV. In Cavendish
Square, under the portico of Harcourt House,
lately demolished, Disraeli said good-bye for
ever to his confederate Lord George Bentinck.
In Hanover Square, Chantrey's stately statue of
William Pitt has looked down on a century of
aristocratic weddings, ascending and descending
the steps of St. George's Church. Sir George
Trevelyan, commenting on a Valentine written
by Macaulay for Lady Mary Stanhope, a great-niece
of Pitt's, declares that "the allusion to the
statue in Hanover Square is one of the happiest
touches that can be found in Macaulay's writings,"
and that is a sufficient justification for quoting it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Prophetic rage my bosom swells;<br />

<p>It is the middle of August, and there is nobody
in London&mdash;except, of course, some four millions
of people who do not count. There is nobody
in London; and, most specially and noticeably,
there is nobody in Church. Be it far from me to
suggest that the Country Cousin and the Transatlantic
Brother, who flood London in August
and September, are persons of indevout habits.
But they have their own methods and places of
devotion (of which I may speak anon), and do
not affect the Parish Churches, with which I am
now concerned. I have excellent opportunities of
judging; for, year in year out, in tropical heat or
Arctic cold, my due feet never fail to walk the
round of our Stuccovian churches, and I can
testify that in August and September Vacancy
and Depression reign unchallenged. Seats are
empty. Galleries are locked. Collections sink
to vanishing-point. The Vicar of St. Ursula's,
Stucco Gardens, accompanied by his second wife,
is sitting under a white umbrella at Dieppe, watching
the aquatic gambols of his twofold family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>

elicits undreamt-of harmonies. The organ-blower
is getting his health in the hopfields. The choirboys
are let loose&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">The congregation represents the mere dregs
and remnants of Stuccovia's social prime. Poor
we have none, and our rich are fled to Scotland
or Norway, Homburg or Marienbad. The seats
are sparsely tenanted by "stern-faced men" (like
those who arrested Eugene Aram), whom business
keeps in London when their hearts are on the
moors; over-burdened mothers, with herds of
restless schoolboys at home for the holidays and
craving for more ardent delights than Stucco
Gardens yield; decayed spinsters of the type of
Volumnia Dedlock, who, having exhausted the
hospitable patience of their ever-diminishing band
of friends, are forced to the horrid necessity of
spending the autumn in London. The only
cheerful face in the church belongs to the Pewopener,
who, being impeded in the discharge of
her function by arthritic rheumatism, is happiest
when congregations are smallest and there are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>

<p class="p1">Evensong is over. The organist is struggling
with an inconceivable tune from "The English
Hymnal" (for at St. Ursula's we are nothing if not
up to date). The Curate, sicklied o'er with that
indescribable horror which in his boating days
he would have described as "The Needle," is
furtively reperusing his manuscript before mounting
the pulpit, and does not detect my craven
flight as I slip through the baize door and disappear.
It is characteristic of St. Ursula's that,
even when empty, it is fusty; but this need
surprise no one, for the architect was strong on a
"scientific system of ventilation," and that, as we
all know, means very little ventilation and an
overwhelming amount of system.</p>

<p>However, my courageous flight has delivered
me from asphyxiation, and, before returning to
my modest Sunday supper of Paysandu Ox-tongue
and sardines, I think that I will reinflate my lungs
by a stroll round Hyde Park. There is a lovely
redness in the western sky over the Serpentine
Bridge, but it is still broad daylight. The sere
and yellow turf of the Park is covered by some of
those four millions who do not count and do not
go to church, but who, apparently, are fond of
sermons. At the end of each hundred yards I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
come upon a preacher of some religious, social,
or political gospel, and round each is gathered a
crowd of listeners who follow his utterances with
interested attention. When I think of St. Ursula's
and the pavid Curate and my graceless flight, I
protest that I am covered with shame as with a
garment. But the wrong done in the church
can be repaired in the Park. I have missed one
sermon, but I will hear another. Unluckily, when
these compunctious visitings seized me I was
standing by a rostrum of heterodoxy. For all I
know the preacher may have followers among my
readers; so, as I would not for the world wound
even the least orthodox susceptibilities, I forbear
to indicate the theory which he enounced. As he
spoke, I seemed to live a former life over again;
for I had once before been present at an exactly
similar preaching, in company, either bodily or
spiritual, with my friend Mr. James Payn, and his
comments on the scene revived themselves in
my memory, even as the remote associations of
Ellangowan reawoke in the consciousness of Harry
Bertram when he returned from his wanderings,
and gazed, bewildered, on his forgotten home.
(Henceforward it is Payn that speaks.) The
preacher of Heterodoxy was entirely without
enthusiasm, nor did his oratory borrow any
meretricious attractions from the Muse. It was
a curious farrago of logic without reason and
premisses without facts, and was certainly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
least popular, though not the least numerously
attended, of all the competing sermons in the
Park. Suddenly the preacher gave expression to
a statement more monstrous than common, on
which an old lady in the crowd, who had heretofore
been listening with great complacency, exclaimed
in horror, "I'm sure <i>this</i> ain't true Gospel,"
and immediately decamped. Up to that point, she
had apparently been listening under the impression
that the preacher belonged to her own blameless
persuasion, and was in the blankest ignorance of
all that he had been driving at.</p>

<p>But Sunday in London has religious attractions
to offer besides those purveyed by St. Ursula's
and Hyde Park. I said at the outset that the
Country Cousin and the Transatlantic Brother
have their own methods and places of devotion&mdash;their
Mecca is St. Paul's Cathedral. One of
the pleasantest ways of spending a Sunday evening
in London is to join the pilgrim-throng. The
great west doors of the Cathedral are flung wide
open, as if to welcome the Archbishop of Canterbury
or the Lord Mayor, and all at once we find
ourselves, hushed and awestruck, in the illimitable
perspective. Even the staunchest believer
in Gothic as the only religious architecture may
admit, with disloyalty to his faith, that every year
St. Paul's becomes more like a place of Christian
worship and less like a glorified Council-hall or
an Imperial Senate-house. And it is seen at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
best in twilight. The shadows temper the garish
splendour of mosaic and gold and electricity, and
enhance the dominant sense of vastness and
grandeur. And prayer ascends on the wings of
music and sweet boy-voices ring, and the distant
altar, with its gleaming lights, focuses the meaning
and purpose of the whole. And then the great
"Communion of Hymns" unites us all, American
and English, Londoner and countryman, as citizens
of a city not built with hands, patriots of a
country which is not marked on the terrestrial
globe. Bernard of Cluny and William Cowper and
John Keble all contribute of their best. "Brief
life is here our portion" seems to utter the real
heart's desire of a tired-looking mechanic who
stands by my side. "Hark, my soul!" seems to
communicate its own intensity to the very tone
and look of the people who are singing it. "Sun
of my soul" is an evening prayer which sounds
just as natural and as fitting in the inmost heart
of London's crowd and grind and pressure as in
the sweet solitude of the Hursley fields. In the
pulpit a pale preacher, himself half worn-out
before his prime by ten years' battle in a slum, is
extolling the Cross as the test and strength and
glory of human life&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"While at his feet the human ocean lay,<br />
And wave on wave rolled into space away."</p>

<p class="p1">A human stream indeed, of all sorts and conditions&mdash;old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
men and maidens, young men and children,
rich and poor, English and foreigners, sightseers
and citizens, dapper clerks and toil-stained citizens
and red-coated soldiers&mdash;all interested, and all at
ease, and all at home at what Bishop Lightfoot
called "the centre of the world's concourse"&mdash;under
the cross-crowned Dome of St. Paul's.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">A SUBURBAN SUNDAY</p>

<p class="p2">"It seems to the writer of this history that the
inhabitants of London are scarcely sufficiently
sensible of the beauty of its environs.... With
the exception of Constantinople, there is no city
in the world that can for a moment enter into
competition with it. For himself, though in his
time something of a rambler, he is not ashamed
in this respect to confess to a legitimate Cockney
taste; and for his part he does not know where
life can flow on more pleasantly than in sight of
Kensington Gardens, viewing the silver Thames
winding by the bowers of Rosebank, or inhaling
from its terraces the refined air of graceful Richmond.
In exactly ten minutes it is in the power
of every man to free himself from all the tumult
of the world and find himself in a sublime sylvan
solitude superior to the Cedars of Lebanon and
inferior only in extent to the chestnut forests of
Anatolia."</p>

<p>The judicious critic will have little difficulty in
assigning this vivid passage to the too-graphic pen
of Lord Beaconsfield; but he will also recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the fact that a description written in 1837 needs
some modification when applied to 1906. The
central solitude of London&mdash;Kensington Gardens&mdash;is
still very much as it was. Just now, its dark
foliage and dusky glades suggest all the romantic
associations of Gustave Doré's forests, with a tall
trooper of the Life Guards and a bashful nursery-maid,
for a Red Cross Knight and an Enchanted
Princess. If we go further afield and climb the uplands
of Highgate and Hampstead, we look down
upon a boundless and beautiful city dimly visible
through a golden haze. But the difference between
the environs of London now and the same
environs when Lord Beaconsfield described them
is that they are now united to the centre by an
unbroken network of gaslit streets. The enormous
increase in the population of London, which every
year brings with it, fills up the gaps and spaces,
and the metropolis is now a solid whole, with its
circumference extending further and further every
day into what a year ago was country. In other
words, the suburbs are getting further off, and
what are suburbs to-day will be town to-morrow;
but still there are suburbs, and a Sunday spent
in them is an interesting experience.</p>

<p>Yesterday the well-known stuffiness of St.
Ursula's, combined with the kind hospitality of
some suburban friends, drove me to spend my
Sunday about ten miles from Stucco Square. It
is a characteristic of people who live in suburbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to believe that their lot is cast in a primæval
solitude, and that, though the Dome of St. Paul's
is plainly visible from their back gardens, the
traveller who ventures to approach them needs
explicit and intricate directions about routes and
trains and changes and stations. The station for
my friend's place was called by a name intensely
suggestive of rurality&mdash;not exactly "Rosebank,"
but Rosebank will serve. Readers of Archbishop
Temple's Life will remember that a clergyman,
excusing himself for living a long way from his
church, urged that it was only three miles as the
crow flies, thereby drawing down on himself the
implacable reply, "But you ain't a crow." In
the same way I found that, though Rosebank is
only ten miles from Stucco Square "as the crow
flies," a human being seeking to approach it must
first make a considerable journey to a central
terminus, must then embark in a train which a
tortoise might outstrip, must change twice, and
must burrow through a sulphurous tunnel; and
must even then run a considerable risk of being
carried through Rosebank Station, which all self-respecting
trains seem to ignore.</p>

<p>Faced by these difficulties, I again took counsel
with Lord Beaconsfield. "''Tis the gondola of
London,' exclaimed Lothair, as he leapt into a
hansom, which he had previously observed to be
well-horsed." My Gondolier was ready with his
terms&mdash;a very liberal payment, several hours' rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
his dinner and tea, and something extra for
putting up his horse. Granted these preliminaries,
he would "do the job on 'is 'ead." It would
"be a little 'oliday to 'im." I in vain suggested
that the opportunity of attending Divine Service
twice at Rosebank Church might be regarded as
part payment of his charge; he replied, with
startling emphasis, that he didn't go into the
country to go to church&mdash;not if he knew it; that,
if I wanted him, I must take him on the terms
proposed; and, further, that I mustn't mind
starting early, for he wanted to get his horse down
cool.</p>

<p>The Gondolier had his own way; and, while the
sparrows were still twittering and the housemaids
were taking in the milk and the Sunday paper,
I was well on my road to Rosebank. This much
I will concede to the curiosity of readers&mdash;that
my road led me out of London in a south-easterly
direction, by the Horseferry, where James II.
dropped the Great Seal into the Thames, along the
Old Kent Road, of which a modern minstrel sang;
past Kennington Common, now a "Park," where
the gallant Jacobites of '45 underwent the hideous
doom of Treason, where the iron-shuttered windows
still commemorate the Chartist rising of '48, and
where Sackville Maine took his Sunday walk with
Mrs. Sackville and old Mrs. Chuff. On past the
"Hamlet of Dulwich," where Mr. Pickwick spent
the last years of his honoured life, to Chislehurst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
where Napoleon III. hid his exiled head, and
North Cray, where the tragedy of Lord Londonderry's
death is not yet forgotten, and Shooters'
Hill, where Jerry Cruncher stopped the coach
with the terrifying message of "Recalled to Life."
Now, as readers are sometimes unduly literal, and
as I would not willingly involve any one in an
hour's fruitless puzzling over a map, let me say
that this itinerary is rather general than particular,
and that, although the Gondolier pursued an extremely
devious course and murmured when I
suggested straighter paths, we did not touch all
the above-mentioned places in our morning's
drive. But evermore we tended south-eastwards,
and evermore the houses grew imperceptibly less
dignified. Stone and stucco we had left behind
us on the northern side of the river, and now it
was a boundless contiguity of brick&mdash;yellow brick,
rather grimy,&mdash;small houses with porticos, slips
of dusty garden between the front door and the
road, and here and there a row of wayside trees.
But everywhere gas, and everywhere <i>omnibi</i> (as
the classical lady said,) and everywhere electric
trams. Churches of every confession and every
architecture lined the way, varied with Public-houses
of many signs, Municipal Buildings of
startling splendour (for Borough Councils have a
flamboyant taste), and Swimming Baths and Public
Libraries, and here and there a private Lunatic
Asylum frowning behind suggestively solemn gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we are in a long and featureless street,
with semi-detached houses on either hand, and
a malodorous cab-stand and a four-faced clock.
"Which way for Rosebank?" shouts the Gondolier.
"The first to your left and then turn sharp
to the right," bellows a responsive policeman. We
follow the direction given, and suddenly we are there&mdash;not
at Rosebank, but quite out of even Greater
London. The street ends abruptly. Trams and
trains and gas and shops are left behind, and all
at once we are in the country. The road is lined
with hedgerows, dusty indeed, but still alive.
Elms of respectable dimensions look down upon
big fields, with here and there an oak, and cows
resting under it. At one turn of the road there is
a recognizable odour of late-cut hay, and in the
middle distance I distinctly perceive a turnip-field,
out of which a covey of partridges might rise
without surprising any one. We pull up and gaze
around. Look where I will, I cannot see a house,
nor even a cottage. Surely my friends have not
played a practical joke on me and asked me to
spend a day in an imaginary Paradise. The
Gondolier looks at his perspiring horse, and mops
his own brow, and gazes contemptuously on the
landscape. "I should call this the world's end
if I was arst," he says. "Blow'd if they've even
got a Public 'Ouse." Suddenly the sound of a
shrill bell bursts on the ear. The Gondolier,
who is a humorist, says "Muffins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>I jump out of the gondola, and pursue the
welcome tinkle round a sharp angle in the road.
There I see, perched on the brow of a sandy
knoll, a small tin building, which a belfry and a
cross proclaim to be a church. Inside I discover
the Oldest Inhabitant pulling the muffin-bell with
cheerful assiduity. He is more than ready to talk,
and his whole discourse is as countrified as if
he lived a hundred miles from Charing Cross.
"Yes, this is a main lonely place. There ain't
many people lives about 'ere. Why, ten years ago
it was all fields. Now there are some houses&mdash;not
many. He lives in one himself. How far
off? Well, a matter of a mile or so. He was
born on the Squire's land; his father worked on
the farm. Yes, he's lived here all his life. Remembers
it before there was a Crystal Palace,
and when there was no railways or nothing. He
hasn't often been in the train, and has only been
up to London two or three times. Who goes
to the church? Well&mdash;not many, except the
Squire's family and the school-children. Why
was it built? Oh, the Squire wants to get some
rich folks to live round about. He's ready to
part with his land for building; and there's going
to be a row of houses built just in front of the
church. He reckons the people will be more
likely to come now that there's a church for
them to go to." And now the "ten-minutes"
bell begins with livelier measure; the Oldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Inhabitant shows me to a seat; and, on the
stroke of eleven, a shrill "Amen" is heard in
the vestry, and there enters a modest procession
of surpliced schoolboys and a clergyman in
a green stole. His sons and daughters, the wife
of the Oldest Inhabitant, and the sisters of the
choristers, from the congregation, eked out by
myself and my friends from Rosebank, who arrive
a little flushed and complain that they have been
waiting for me. The "service is fully choral," as
they say in accounts of fashionable weddings;
the clergyman preaches against the Education
Bill, and a collection (of copper) is made to
defray the expenses of a meeting at the Albert
Hall. It is pleasant to see that, even in these
secluded districts, the watch-dogs of the Church
are on the alert.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XX</h2>

<p class="pch">WINE AND WATER</p>

<p class="p2">The second and third words are added to the title
in deference to the weather. One must be a
hardened toper if, with the thermometer at 93 in
the shade, one can find comfort in the thought of
undiluted wine. Rather I would take pattern from
Thackeray's friend the Bishop, with his "rounded
episcopal apron." "He put water into his wine.
Let us respect the moderation of the Established
Church." But water is an after-thought, incidental
and ephemeral. It was on wine that I was
meditating when the mercury rushed up and put
more temperate thoughts into my head, and it
was Sir Victor Horsley who set me on thinking
about wine. Sir Victor has been discoursing at
Ontario about the mischiefs of Alcohol, and the
perennial controversy has revived in all its accustomed
vigour. Once every five years some leading
light of the medical profession declares with much
solemnity that Alcohol is a poison, that Wine is
the foundation of death, and that Gingerbeer or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Toast-and-Water or Zoedone or Kopps or some
kindred potion is the true and the sole elixir
of life. Sir Oracle always chooses August or
September for the delivery of his dogma, and
immediately there ensues a correspondence which
suitably replaces "Ought Women to Propose?"
"Do We Believe?" and "What is Wrong?"
Enthusiastic teetotallers fill the columns of the
press with letters which in their dimensions rival
the Enormous Gooseberry and in their demands
on our credulity exceed the Sea Serpent. To
these reply the advocates of Alcohol, with statistical
accounts of patriarchs who always breakfasted on
half-and-half, and near and dear relations who
were rescued from the jaws of death by a timely
exhibition of gin and bitters. And so the game
goes merrily on till October recalls us to common
sense.</p>

<p>Thus far, the gem of this autumn's correspondence
is, I think, the following instance contributed
by an opponent of Sir Victor Horsley:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A British officer lay on his camp-bed in India
suffering from cholera. His medical attendants
had concluded that nothing more could be done
for him, and that his seizure must end fatally.
His friends visited him to shake his hand and to
offer their sympathetic good-byes, including his
dearest regimental chum, who, deciding to keep
his emotion down by assuming a cheerful demeanour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
remarked, 'Well, old chap, we all must
go sometime and somehow. Is there anything
you would like me to get you?' Hardly able to
speak, the sufferer indicated, 'I'll take a drop of
champagne with you, as a last friendly act, if I
can get it down.' With difficulty he took a little,
and still lives to tell the story."</p>

<p>Since the "affecting instance of Colonel Snobley"
we have had nothing quite so rich as that&mdash;unless,
indeed, it was the thrill of loyal rejoicing which
ran round the nation when, just before Christmas
1871, it was announced that our present Sovereign,
then in the throes of typhoid, had called for a
glass of beer. Then, like true Britons, reared on
malt and hops, we felt that all was well, and
addressed ourselves to our Christmas turkey with
the comfortable assurance that the Prince of
Wales had turned the corner. Reared on malt
and hops, I said; but many other ingredients went
to the system on which some of us were reared.
"That poor creature, small beer" at meal-time,
was reinforced by a glass of port wine at eleven,
by brandy and water if ever one looked squeamish,
by mulled claret at bedtime in cold weather, by
champagne on all occasions of domestic festivity,
and by hot elderberry wine if one had a cold in
the head. Poison? quotha. It was like Fontenelle's
coffee, and, even though some of us have
not yet turned eighty, at any rate we were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
cut off untimely nor hurried into a drunkard's
grave. And then think of the men whom the
system produced! Thackeray (who knew what
he was talking about) said that "our intellect
ripens with good cheer and throws off surprising
crops under the influence of that admirable liquid,
claret." But all claret, according to Dr. Johnson,
would be port if it could; and a catena of port
wine-drinkers could contain some of the most
famous names of the last century. Mr. Gladstone,
to whom the other pleasures of the table meant
nothing, was a stickler for port, a believer in it, a
judge of it. The only feeble speech which, in my
hearing, he ever made was made after dining at
an otherwise hospitable house where wine was
not suffered to appear. Lord Tennyson, until
vanquished by Sir Andrew Clark, drank his bottle
of port every day, and drank it undecanted, for,
as he justly observed, a decanter holds only eight
glasses, but a black bottle nine. Mr. Browning,
if he could have his own way, drank port all
through dinner as well as after it. Sir Moses
Montefiore, who, as his kinsfolk said, got up to
par&mdash;or, in other words, completed his hundred
years,&mdash;had drunk a bottle of port every day
since he came to man's estate. Dr. Charles
Sumner, the last Prince-Bishop of Winchester, so
comely and benign that he was called "The
Beauty of Holiness," lent ecclesiastical sanction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to the same tradition by not only drinking port
himself but distributing it with gracious generosity
to impoverished clergy. But, if I were
to sing all the praises of port, I should have no
room for other wines.</p>

<p>Sherry&mdash;but no. Just now it is a point of
literary honour not to talk about sherry;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> so,
Dante-like, I do not reason about that particular
wine, but gaze and pass on&mdash;only remarking, as I
pass, that Mr. Ruskin's handsome patrimony was
made out of sherry, and that this circumstance
lent a peculiar zest to his utterances from the
professorial chair at Oxford about the immorality
of Capital and "the sweet poison of misusèd
wine." An enthusiastic clergyman who wore the
Blue Ribbon had been urging on Archbishop
Benson his own strong convictions about the
wickedness of wine-drinking. That courtly prelate
listened with tranquil sympathy till the orator
stopped for breath, and then observed, in suavest
accents, "And yet I always think that good claret
tastes very like a good creature of God." There
are many who, in the depths of their conscience,
agree with his Grace; and they would drink
claret and nothing but claret if they could get it
at dinner. Far distant are the days when Lord
Alvanley said, "The little wine I drink I drink at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
dinner,&mdash;but the great deal of wine I drink I drink
after dinner." Nowadays no one drinks any after
dinner. The King killed after-dinner drinking
when he introduced cigarettes. But, for some
inexplicable reason, men who have good claret
will not produce it at dinner. They wait till the
air is poisoned and the palate deadened with
tobacco, and then complain that nobody drinks
claret. The late Lord Granville (who had spent
so many years of his life in taking the chair at
public dinners that his friends called him Pére La
Chaise) once told me that, where you are not sure
of your beverages, it was always safest to drink
hock. So little was drunk in England that it was
not worth while to adulterate it. Since those
days the still wines of Mosel have flooded the
country, and it is difficult to repress the conviction
that the principal vineyards must belong to the
Medical Faculty, so persistently and so universally
do they prescribe those rather dispiriting vintages.</p>

<p>But, after all said and done, when we in the
twentieth century say Wine, we mean champagne,
even as our fathers meant port. And in champagne
we have seen a silent but epoch-making
revolution. I well remember the champagne of
my youth; a liquid esteemed more precious than
gold, and dribbled out into saucer-shaped glasses
half-way through dinner on occasions of high
ceremony. It was thick and sticky; in colour a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
sort of brick-dust red, and it scarcely bubbled, let
alone foaming or sparkling.</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"How sad, and bad, and mad it was,&mdash;<br />
And oh! how it was sweet!"</p>

<p class="pn1">Nowadays, we are told, more champagne is drunk
in Russia than is grown in France. And the
"foaming grape," which Tennyson glorified, is so
copiously diluted that it ranks only immediately
above small beer in the scale of alcoholic
strength. Mr. Finching, the wine-merchant in
"Little Dorrit," thought it "weak but palatable,"
and Lord St. Jerome in "Lothair" was esteemed
by the young men a "patriot," "because he
always gave his best champagne at his ball
suppers." Such patriotism as that, at any rate,
is not the refuge of a scoundrel.</p>

<p><i>Wine and Water.</i> I return to my beginnings,
and, as I ponder the innocuous theme, all sorts
of apt citations come crowding on the Ear of
Memory. Bards of every age and clime have
sung the praises of wine, but songs in praise of
water are more difficult to find. Once on a time,
when a Maid of Honour had performed a rather
mild air on the piano, Queen Victoria asked her
what it was called. "A German Drinking-Song,
ma'am." "Drinking-Song! One couldn't drink
a cup of tea to it." A kindred feebleness seems
to have beset all the poets who have tried to
hymn the praises of water; nor was it overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
till some quite recent singer, who had not
forgotten his Pindar, thus improved on the immortal
<i>Ariston men hudor</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"Pure water is the best of gifts<br />
That man to man can bring;</p>
<p class="pin4">But what am I, that I should have<br />

<p class="pch">DINNER</p>

<p class="piq2 p1">"We may live without poetry, music, and art;</p>
<p class="pin2">We may live without conscience and live without heart;</p>
<p class="pin2">We may live without friends; we may live without books;</p>
<p class="pin2">But civilized man cannot live without Cooks.</p>

<p class="piq2 p1">"He may live without lore&mdash;what is knowledge but grieving?</p>
<p class="pin2">He may live without hope&mdash;what is hope but deceiving?</p>
<p class="pin2">He may live without love&mdash;what is passion but pining?</p>
<p class="pin2">But where is the man that can live without dining?"</p>

<p class="p2">The poet who wrote those feeling lines acted up
to what he professed, and would, I think, have
been interested in our present subject; for he it
was who, in the mellow glory of his literary and
social fame, said: "It is many years since I felt
hungry; but, thank goodness, I am still greedy."
In my youth there used to be a story of a High
Sheriff who, having sworn to keep the jury in a
trial for felony locked up without food or drink
till they had agreed upon their verdict, was told
that one of them was faint and had asked for a
glass of water. The High Sheriff went to the
Judge and requested his directions. The Judge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
after due reflection, ruled as follows: "You have
sworn not to give the jury food or drink till they
have agreed upon their verdict. A glass of water
certainly is not food; and, for my own part, I
shouldn't call it drink. Yes; you can give the
man a glass of water."</p>

<p>In a like spirit, I suppose that most of us would
regard wine as being, if not of the essence, at
least an inseparable accident, of Dinner; but the
subject of wine has been so freely handled in a
previous chapter that, though it is by no means
exhausted, we will to-day treat it only incidentally,
and as it presents itself in connexion with the
majestic theme of Dinner.</p>

<p>The great Lord Holland, famed in Memoirs,
was greater in nothing than in his quality of host;
and, like all the truly great, he manifested all
his noblest attributes on the humblest occasions.
Thus, he was once entertaining a schoolboy, who
had come to spend a whole holiday at Holland
House, and, in the openness of his heart, he told
the urchin that he might have what he liked for
dinner. "Young in years, but in sage counsels
old," as the divine Milton says, the Westminster
boy demanded, not sausages and strawberry cream,
but a roast duck with green peas, and an apricot
tart. The delighted host brushed away a tear
of sensibility, and said, "My boy, if in all the
important questions of your life you decide as
wisely as you have decided now, you will be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
great and a good man." The prophecy was
verified, and surely the incident deserved to be embalmed
in verse; but, somehow, the poets always
seem to have fought shy of Dinner. Byron, as
might be expected, comes nearest to the proper
inspiration when he writes of</p>

<p class="piq8 p1">"A roast and a ragout,</p>
<p class="pin4">And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd."</p>

<p class="pn1">But even this is tepid. Owen Meredith, in the
poem from which I have already quoted, gives
some portion of a menu in metre. Sydney Smith,
as we all know, wrote a recipe for a salad in heroic
couplets. Prior, I think, describes a City Feast,
bringing in "swan and bustard" to rhyme with
"tart and custard." The late Mr. Mortimer Collins
is believed to have been the only writer who ever
put "cutlet" into a verse. When Rogers wrote
"the rich relics of a well-spent hour" he was not&mdash;though
he ought to have been&mdash;thinking of
dinner. Shakespeare and Spenser, and Milton and
Wordsworth, and Shelley and Tennyson deal only
with fragments and fringes of the great subject.
They mention a joint or a dish, a vintage or a
draught, but do not harmonize and co-ordinate
even such slight knowledge of gastronomy as they
may be supposed to have possessed. In fact, the
subject was too great for them, and they wisely
left it to the more adequate medium of prose.
Among the prose-poets who have had the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
feeling for Dinner, Thackeray stands supreme.
When he describes it facetiously, as in "The
Little Dinner at Timmins's" or "A Dinner in
the City," he is good; but he is far, far better
when he treats a serious theme seriously, as in
"Memorials of Gormandizing" and "Greenwich
Whitebait."</p>

<p>I assign the first place to Thackeray because
his eulogy is more finished, more careful, more
delicate; but Sir Walter had a fine, free style,
a certain broadness of effect, in describing a
dinner which places him high in the list. Those
venison pasties and spatchcocked eels and butts
of Rhenish wine and stoups of old Canary which
figure so largely in the historical novels still
make my mouth water. The dinner which Rob
Roy gave Bailie Nicol Jarvie, though of necessity
cold, was well conceived; and, barring the solan
goose, I should have deeply enjoyed the banquet
at which the Antiquary entertained Sir Arthur
Wardour. The imaginary feast which Caleb
Balderstone prepared for the Lord Keeper was so
good that it deserved to be real. Dickens, the
supreme exponent of High Tea, knew very little
about Dinner, though I remember a good meal of
the <i>bourgeois</i> type at the house of the Patriarch in
"Little Dorrit." Lord Lytton dismissed even a
bad dinner all too curtly when he said that "the
soup was cold, the ice was hot, and everything in
the house was sour except the vinegar." James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Payn left in his one unsuccessful book, "Melib&oelig;us
in London," the best account, because the simplest,
of a Fish-dinner at Greenwich; in that special
department he is run close by Lord Beaconsfield
in "Tancred"; but it is no disgrace to be equalled
or even surpassed by the greatest man who ever
described a dinner. With Lord Beaconsfield gastronomy
was an instinct; it breathes in every
page of his Letters to his Sister. He found a
roast swan "very white and good." He dined
out "to meet some truffles&mdash;very agreeable company."
At Sir Robert Peel's he reported "the
second course really remarkable," and noted the
startling fact that Sir Robert "boldly attacked his
turbot with his knife." It was he, I believe,
who said of a rival Chancellor of the Exchequer
that his soup was made from "deferred stock."
'Twere long to trace the same generous enthusiasm
for Dinner through all Lord Beaconsfield's
Novels. He knew the Kitchen of the Past as well
as of the Present. Lady Annabel's Bill of Fare in
"Venetia" is a monument of culinary scholarship.
Is there anything in fiction more moving than the
agony of the <i>chef</i> at Lord Montacute's coming
of age? "It was only by the most desperate
personal exertions that I rescued the <i>soufflés</i>. It
was an affair of the Bridge of Arcola." And, if
it be objected that all these scenes belong to a
rather remote past, let us take this vignette of the
fashionable solicitor in "Lothair," Mr. Putney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Giles, as he sits down to dinner after a day of
exciting work: "It is a pleasent thing to see an
opulent and prosperous man of business, sanguine
and full of health and a little overworked, at that
royal meal, Dinner. How he enjoys his soup!
And how curious in his fish! How critical in his
<i>entrée</i>, and how nice in his Welsh mutton! His
exhausted brain rallies under the glass of dry
sherry, and he realizes all his dreams with the aid
of claret that has the true flavour of the violet."
"Doctors," said Thackeray, who knew and loved
them, "notoriously dine well. When my excellent
friend Sangrado takes a bumper, and saying,
with a shrug and a twinkle of his eye, <i>Video meliora
proboque, Deteriora sequor</i>, tosses off the wine, I
always ask the butler for a glass of that bottle."
That tradition of medical gastronomy dates from
a remote period of our history. "Culina," by
far the richest Cookery-book ever composed, was
edited and given to the world in 1810 by a
doctor&mdash;"A. Hunter, M.D., F.R.S." Dr. William
Kitchener died in 1827, but not before his "Cook's
Oracle" and "Peptic Precepts" had secured him
an undying fame. In our own days, Sir Henry
Thompson's "Octaves" were the most famous
dinners in London, both as regards food and
wine; and his "Food and Feeding" is the best
guide-book to greediness I know. But here I
feel that I am descending into details. "Dear
Bob, I have seen the mahoganies of many men."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
But to-day I am treating of Dinner rather than of
dinners&mdash;of the abstract Idea which has its real
existence in a higher sphere,&mdash;not of the concrete
forms in which it is embodied on this earth.
Perhaps further on I may have a word to say
about "Dinners."</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">DINNERS</p>

<p><i>Sero sed serio.</i> It is the motto of the House of
Cecil; and the late Lord Salisbury, long detained
by business at the Foreign Office and at length
sitting down to his well-earned dinner, used to
translate it&mdash;"Unpunctual, but hungry." Such a
formula may suitably introduce the subject of our
present meditations; and, although that subject is
not temporary or ephemeral, but rather belongs
to all time, still at this moment it is specially
opportune. Sir James Crichton-Browne has been
frightening us to death with dark tales of physical
degeneration, and he has been heartless enough
to do so just when we are reeling under the
effects of Sir Victor Horsley's attack on Alcohol.
Burke, in opposing a tax on gin, pleaded that
"mankind have in every age called in some
material assistance to their moral consolation."
These modern men of science tell us that we
must by no means call in gin or any of its more
genteel kinsfolk in the great family of Alcohol.
Water hardly seems to meet the case&mdash;besides,
it has typhoid germs in it. Tea and coffee are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
"nerve-stimulants," and must therefore be avoided
by a neurotic generation. Physical degeneracy,
then, must be staved off with food; food, in a
sound philosophy of life, means Dinner; and
Dinner, the ideal or abstraction, reveals itself to
man in the concrete form of Dinners.</p>

<p>Having thus formulated my theme, I part company,
here and now, with poets and romancists
and all that dreamy crew, and betake myself,
like Mr. Gradgrind, to facts. In loftier phrase, I
pursue the historic method, and narrate, with the
accuracy of Freeman, though, alas! without the
brilliancy of Froude, some of the actual dinners
on which mankind has lived. Creasy wrote of
the "Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World"&mdash;the
Fifteen Decisive Dinners of the World would be
a far more interesting theme; but the generous
catalogue unrolls its scroll, and "fifteen" would
have to be multiplied by ten or a hundred before
the tale was told. A friend of mine had a pious
habit of pasting into an album the <i>Menu</i> of every
dinner at which he had enjoyed himself. Studying
the album retrospectively, he used to put an
asterisk against the most memorable of these
records. There were three asterisks against the
<i>Menu</i> of a dinner given by Lord Lyons at the
British Embassy at Paris. "<i>Quails and Roman
Punch</i>," said my friend with tears in his voice.
"You can't get beyond that." This evidently
had been one of the Fifteen Decisive Dinners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
his gastronomic world. Did not the poet Young
exclaim, in one of his most pietistic "Night
Thoughts,"</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"The undevout Gastronomer is mad"?</p>

<p class="pn1">Or, has an unintended "G" crept into the line?</p>

<p>I treasure among my relics the "Bill of Fare"
(for in those days we talked English) of a Tavern
Dinner for seven persons, triumphantly eaten in
1751. Including vegetables and dessert, and excluding
beverages, it comprises thirty-eight items;
and the total cost was £81, 11s. 6d. (without
counting the Waiter). Twenty years later than
the date of this heroic feast Dr. Johnson, who
certainly could do most things which required the
use of a pen, vaunted in his overweening pride
that he could write a cookery-book, and not only
this, but "a better book of cookery than has ever
yet been written; it should be a book on philosophical
principles." The philosophical principles
must have been those of the Stoic school if they
could induce his readers or his guests to endure
patiently such a dinner as he gave poor Bozzy on
Easter-day, 1773&mdash;"a very good soup, a boiled
leg of lamb and spinach, a veal pie, and a rice
pudding." One is glad to know that the soup
was good; for, as Sir Henry Thompson said in
"Food and Feeding," "the <i>rationale</i> of the initial
soup has been often discussed," and the best
opinion is that the function of the soup is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fortify the digestion against what is to come. A
man who is to dine on boiled lamb, veal pie, and
rice pudding needs all the fortifying he can get.
With some of us it would indeed be a "decisive"
dinner&mdash;the last which we should consume on
this planet.</p>

<p>True enjoyment, as well as true virtue, lies in
the Golden Mean; and, as we round the corner
where the eighteenth century meets the nineteenth,
we begin to encounter a system of dining
less profligately elaborate than the Tavern Dinner
of 1751, and yet less poisonously crude than Dr.
Johnson's Easter Dinner of 1773. The first Earl
of Dudley (who died in 1833) disdained kickshaws,
and, with manly simplicity, demanded only "a
good soup, a small turbot, a neck of venison, ducklings
with green peas (or chicken with asparagus),
and an apricot tart." Even more meagre was the
repast which Macaulay deemed sufficient for his
own wants and those of a friend: "Ellis came to
dinner at seven. I gave him a lobster curry, woodcock,
and maccaroni." From such frugality, bordering
on asceticism, it is a relief to turn to the more
bounteous hospitality of Sir Robert Peel, of whose
dinner the youthful Disraeli wrote: "It was curiously
sumptuous; every delicacy of the season, and
the second course, of dried salmon, olives, caviare,
woodcock pie, <i>foiegras</i>, and every combination of
cured herring, &amp;c., was really remarkable." Yes,
indeed! "on dine remarquablement chez vous."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, the social life of the capital naturally
takes its tone and manner from the august centre
round which it moves. If the Court dines well,
so do those who frequent it. The legs of mutton
and apple dumplings which satisfied the simple
taste of George III. read now like a horrid dream.
Perhaps, as the digestion and the brain are so
closely connected, they helped to drive him mad.
His sons ate more reasonably; and, in a later
generation, gastronomic science in high places was
quickened by the thoughtful intelligence of Prince
Albert directing the practical skill of Francatelli
and Moret. Here is a brief abstract or epitome
of Queen Victoria's dinner on the 21st of September
1841. It begins modestly with two
soups; it goes on, more daringly, to four kinds
of fish; four also are the joints, followed (not,
as now, preceded) by eight <i>entrées</i>. Then come
chickens and partridges; vegetables, savouries,
and sweets to the number of fifteen: and, lest
any one should still suffer from the pangs of unsatiated
desire, there were thoughtfully placed on
the sideboard Roast Beef, Roast Mutton, Haunch
of Venison, Hashed Venison, and <i>Riz au consommé</i>.
But those were famous days. Fifty-four years
had sped their course, and Her Majesty's Christmas
Dinner in the year 1895 shows a lamentable
shrinkage. Three soups indeed there were, but
only one fish, and that a Fried Sole, which can be
produced by kitchens less than Royal. To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
succeeded a beggarly array of four <i>entrées</i>, three
joints, and two sorts of game; but the <i>Menu</i> recovers
itself a little in seven sweet dishes; while
the sideboard displayed the "Boar's Head, Baron
of Beef, and Woodcock Pie," which supplied the
thrifty Journalist with appropriate copy at every
Christmas of Her Majesty's long reign.</p>

<p>When Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli had succeeded
in "dishing the Whigs" by establishing
Household Suffrage, they and their colleagues
went with a light heart and a good conscience to
dine at the Ship Hotel, Greenwich, on the 14th
of August 1867. That was, in some senses, a
"decisive" dinner, for it sealed the destruction of
the old Conservatism and inaugurated the reign of
Tory Democracy. The triumphant Ministers had
turtle soup, eleven kinds of fish, two <i>entrées</i>, a
haunch of venison, poultry, ham, grouse, leverets,
five sweet dishes, and two kinds of ice. Eliminating
the meat, this is very much the same sort of
dinner as that at which Cardinal Wiseman was
entertained by his co-religionists when he assumed
the Archbishopric of Westminster, and I remember
that his Life, by Mr. Wilfred Ward, records
the dismay with which his "maigre" fare inspired
more ascetic temperaments. "He kept the table
of a Roman Cardinal, and surprised some Puseyite
guests by four courses of fish in Lent." There
is something very touching in the exculpatory
language of his friend and disciple Father Faber&mdash;"The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
dear Cardinal had a Lobster-salad side to
his character."</p>

<p>Ever since the days of Burns, the "chiel amang
ye takin' notes" has been an unpopular character,
and not without reason, as the following
extract shows. Mr. John Evelyn Denison (afterwards
Lord Eversley) was Speaker of the House of
Commons in 1865, and on the eve of the opening
of the Session he dined, according to custom, with
Lord Palmerston, then Prime Minister and Leader
of the House. Lord Palmerston was in his eighty-first
year and gouty. Political issues of the gravest
importance hung on his life. The Speaker, like a
<i>rusé</i> old politician as he was, kept a cold grey eye
on Palmerston's performance at dinner, regarding
it, rightly, as an index to his state of health; and
this was what he reported about his host's capacities:
"His dinner consisted of turtle soup, fish,
patties, fricandeau, a third <i>entrée</i>, a slice of roast
mutton, a second slice, a slice of hard-looking
ham. In the second course, pheasant, pudding,
jelly. At dessert, dressed oranges and half a
large pear. He drank seltzer water only, but late
in the dinner one glass of sweet champagne, and,
I think, a glass of sherry at dessert." This was one
of the "decisive" dinners, for Palmerston died in
the following October. The only wonder is that
he lived so long. The dinner which killed the
Duke of Wellington was a cold pie and a salad.</p>

<p>"I am not one who much or oft delight" to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
mingle the serious work of Dinner with the frivolities
of Literature; but other people, more prone
to levity, are fond of constructing Bills of Fare
out of Shakespeare; and our National Bard is so
copious in good eating and drinking that a dozen
<i>Menus</i> might be bodied forth from his immortal
page. The most elaborate of these attempts took
place in New York on the 23rd of April 1860.
The Bill of Fare lies before me as I write. It
contains twenty-four items, and an appropriate
quotation is annexed to each. The principal joint
was Roast Lamb, and to this is attached the tag&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq8 p1">"Innocent</p>
<p class="pin4">As is the sucking lamb."</p>

<p class="pn1">When the late Professor Thorold Rogers, an
excellent Shakespearean, saw this citation, he exclaimed,
"That was an opportunity missed. They
should have put&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">'So young, and so untender!'"</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">LUNCHEON</p>

<p class="ppi4 p2">"Munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,<br />
Breakfast, dinner, supper, luncheon!"</p>

<p class="p1">So sings, or says, Robert Browning in his ditty
of the Pied Piper, and it is to be remarked that
he was not driven to invent the word "nuncheon"
by the necessity of finding a rhyme for "luncheon,"
for "puncheon" was ready to his hand, and "nuncheon"
was not a creation, but an archaism, defined
by Johnson as "food eaten between meals."
Let no one who perpends the amazing dinners
eaten by our forefathers accuse those good men
of gluttony. Let us rather bethink ourselves of
their early and unsatisfying breakfasts, their lives
of strenuous labour, their ignorance of five o'clock
tea; and then thank the goodness and the grace
which on our birth have smiled, and have given us
more frequent meals and less ponderous dinners.
Lord John Russell (1792-1878) published anonymously
in 1820 a book of Essays and Sketches
"by a Gentleman who has left his Lodgings." On
the usages of polite society at the time no one
was better qualified to speak, for Woburn Abbey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was his home, and at Bowood and Holland House
he was an habitual guest; and this is his testimony
to the dining habits of society: "The great inconvenience
of a London life is the late hour of
dinner. To pass the day <i>impransus</i> and then to
sit down to a great dinner at eight o'clock is
entirely against the first dictates of common sense
and common stomachs. Women, however, are
not so irrational as men, and generally sit down
to a substantial luncheon at three or four; if men
would do the same, the meal at night might be
lightened of many of its weighty dishes and conversation
would be no loser." So far, Luncheon
(or Nuncheon) would seem to be exclusively a
ladies' meal; and yet Dr. Kitchener could not have
been prescribing for ladies only when he gave
his surprising directions for a luncheon "about
twelve," which might "consist of a bit of roasted
Poultry, a basin of Beef Tea or Eggs poached or
boiled in the shell, Fish plainly dressed, or a Sandwich;
stale Bread, and half a pint of good Home-brewed
Beer, or Toast and Water, with about one
fourth or one-third part of its measure of Wine, of
which Port is preferred, or one-seventh of Brandy."</p>

<p>In Miss Austen's books, Luncheon is dismissed
under the cursory appellation of "Cold Meat,"
and Madeira and water seems to have been its
accompaniment; but more prodigal methods soon
began to creep in. The repast which Sam Weller
pronounced "a wery good notion of a lunch"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
consisted of veal pie, bread, knuckle of ham, cold
beef, beer, and cold punch; and let it be observed
in passing that, had he used the word "lunch" in
polite society, the omission of the second syllable
would have been severely reprehended by a generation
which still spoke of the "omnibus" and had
only just discontinued "cabriolet." The verb "to
lunch" was even more offensive than the substantive
from which it was derived; and Lord
Beaconsfield, describing the Season of 1832, says
that "ladies were luncheoning on Perigord pie,
or coursing in whirling britskas." To Perigord
pies as a luncheon dish for the luxurious and
eupeptic may be added venison pasties&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Now broach me a cask of Malvoisie,<br />
Bring pasty from the doe,"</p>

<p class="pn1">said the Duchess in "Coningsby." "That has
been my luncheon&mdash;a poetic repast." And Lady
St. Jerome, when she took Lothair to a picnic, fed
him with lobster sandwiches and Chablis. Fiction
is ever the mirror of fact; and a lady still living,
who published her Memoirs only a year or two
ago, remembers the Lady Holland who patronized
Macaulay "sitting at a beautiful luncheon of cold
turkey and summer salad."</p>

<p>But, in spite of all these instances, Luncheon
was down to 1840 or thereabouts a kind of clandestine
and unofficial meal. The ladies wanted
something to keep them up. It was nicer for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
children than having their dinner in the nursery.
Papa would be kept at the House by an impending
division, and must get a snack when he could&mdash;and
so on and so forth. If a man habitually sate
down to luncheon, and ate it through, he was
contemned as unversed in the science of feeding.
"Luncheon is a reflection on Breakfast and an
insult to Dinner;" and moreover it stamped the
eater as an idler. No one who had anything to
do could find time for a square meal in the
middle of the day. When Mr. Gladstone was at
the Board of Trade, his only luncheon consisted
of an Abernethy biscuit which Mrs. Gladstone
brought down to the office and forced on the
reluctant Vice-President.</p>

<p>But after 1840 a change set in. Prince Albert
was notoriously fond of luncheon, and Queen
Victoria humoured him. They dined late, and
the Luncheon at the Palace became a very real
and fully recognized meal. At it the Queen
sometimes received her friends, as witness the
Royal Journal&mdash;"Mamma came to luncheon with
her lady and gentleman." It could not have
been pleasant for the "lady and gentleman," but
it established the practice.</p>

<p>"Sunday luncheon" was always a thing apart.
For some reason not altogether clear, but either
because devotion long sustained makes a strong
demand on the nervous system or because a
digestive nap was the best way of employing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Sunday afternoon, men who ate no luncheon on
week-days devoured Roast Beef and Yorkshire
Pudding on Sundays and had their appropriate
reward. Bishop Wilberforce, whose frank self-communings
are always such delightful reading,
wrote in his diary for Sunday, October 27, 1861:
"Preached in York Minster. Very large congregation.
Back to Bishopthorpe. Sleepy, <i>eheu</i>,
at afternoon service; <i>must</i> eat no luncheon on
Sunday." When Luncheon had once firmly established
itself, not merely as a meal but as an
institution, Sunday luncheons in London became
recognized centres of social life. Where there
was even a moderate degree of intimacy a guest
might drop in and be sure of mayonnaise, chicken,
and welcome. I well remember an occasion of
this kind when I saw social Presence of Mind
exemplified, as I thought and think, on an heroic
scale. Luncheon was over. It had not been a
particularly bounteous meal; the guests had been
many; the chicken had been eaten to the drumstick
and the cutlets to the bone. Nothing remained
but a huge Trifle, of chromatic and
threatening aspect, on which no one had ventured
to embark. Coffee was just coming, when the
servant entered with an anxious expression, and
murmured to the hostess that Monsieur Petitpois&mdash;a
newly arrived French attaché&mdash;had come
and seemed to expect luncheon. The hostess
grasped the situation in an instant, and issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
her commands with a promptitude and a directness
which the Duke of Wellington could not have
surpassed. "Clear everything away, but leave
the Trifle. Then show M. Petitpois in." Enter
Petitpois. "Delighted to see you. Quite right.
Always at home at Sunday luncheon. Pray come
and sit here and have some Trifle. It is our
national Sunday dish." Poor young Petitpois,
actuated by the same principle which made the
Prodigal desire the husks, filled himself with
sponge-cake, jam, and whipped cream; and went
away looking rather pale. If he kept a journal,
he no doubt noted the English Sunday as one of
our most curious institutions, and the Trifle as its
crowning horror.</p>

<p>Cardinal Manning, as all the world knows,
never dined. "I never eat and I never drink,"
said the Cardinal. "I am sorry to say I cannot.
I like dinner society very much. You see the
world, and you hear things which you do not
hear otherwise." Certainly that Cardinal was a fictitious
personage, but he was drawn with fidelity
from Cardinal Manning, who ate a very comfortable
dinner at two o'clock, called it luncheon,
and maintained his principle. There have always
been some houses where the luncheons were much
more famous than the dinners. Dinner, after all,
is something of a ceremony: it requires forethought,
care, and organization. Luncheon is more
of a scramble, and, in the case of a numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and scattered family, it is the pleasantest of reunions.
"When all the daughters are married
nobody eats luncheon," said Lothair to his
solicitor, Mr. Putney Giles: but Mr. Putney Giles,
"who always affected to know everything, and
generally did," replied that, even though the
daughters were married, "the famous luncheons
at Crecy House would always go on and be a
popular mode of their all meeting." When Lord
Beaconsfield wrote that passage he was thinking
of Chesterfield House, May Fair, some twenty
years before Lord Burton bought it. Mr. Gladstone,
who thought modern luxury rather disgusting,
used to complain that nowadays life in a
country house meant three dinners a day, and if
you reckoned sandwiches and poached eggs at
five o'clock tea, nearly four. Indeed, the only
difference that I can perceive between a modern
luncheon and a modern dinner is that at the
former meal you don't have soup or a printed
<i>menu</i>. But at a luncheon at the Mansion House
you have both; so it is well for Lord Mayors
that their reigns are brief.</p>

<p>One touch of personal reminiscence may close
this study. While yet the Old Bailey stood erect
and firm, as grim in aspect as in association, I
used often, through the courtesy of a civic official,
to share the luncheon of the judge and the
aldermen, eaten during an interval in the trial, in
a gloomy chamber behind the Bench. I still see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in my mind's eye, a learned judge, long since gone
to his account, stuffing cold beef and pigeon pie,
and quaffing London stout, black as Erebus and
heavy as lead. After this repast he went back
into Court (where he never allowed a window to
be opened) and administered what he called
justice through the long and lethargic afternoon.
No one who had witnessed the performance
could doubt the necessity for a Court of Criminal
Appeal.</p>

<p class="pch">TEA</p>

<p>Few, I fear, are the readers of Mrs. Sherwood.
Yet in "The Fairchild Family" she gave us some
pictures of English country life at the end of the
eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth
century which neither Jane Austen nor Mrs.
Gaskell ever beat, and at least one scene of horror
which is still unsurpassed. I cannot say as much
for "Henry Milner, or the Story of a Little Boy
who was not brought up according to the Fashions
of this World." No, indeed&mdash;very far from it.
And Henry now recurs to my mind only because,
in narrating his history, Mrs. Sherwood archly introduces
a sentence which may serve as a motto
for this meditation. Like Bismarck (though unlike
him in other respects), she was fond of
parading scraps of a rather bald Latinity; and,
in this particular instance, she combines simple
scholarship with staid humour, making her hero
exclaim to a tea-making lady, "Non possum vivere
sine Te." The play on <i>Te</i> and <i>Tea</i> will be remarked
as very ingenious. Barring the Latinity
and the jest, I am at one with Mrs. Sherwood in
the sentiment, "My heart leaps up when I behold"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a teapot, like Wordsworth's when he beheld
a rainbow; and the mere mention of tea in literature
stirs in me thoughts which lie too deep for
words. Thus I look forward with the keenest
interest to</p>

<h3 class="p2">
THE BOOK OF TEA</h3>

<p class="psh"><span class="smcap">By Okakura-Kakuzo</span></p>

<p class="pn">which the publishers promise at an early date.
Solemn indeed, as befits the subject, is the preliminary
announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This book in praise of tea, written by a
Japanese, will surely find sympathetic readers in
England, where the custom of tea-drinking has
become so important a part of the national daily
life. Mr. Kakuzo shows that the English are still
behind the Japanese in their devotion to tea. In
England afternoon tea is variously regarded as a
fashionable and luxurious aid to conversation, a
convenient way of passing the time, or a restful
and refreshing pause in the day's occupation, but
in Japan tea-drinking is ennobled into Teaism, and
the English cup of tea seems trivial by comparison."</p>

<p>This is the right view of Tea. The wrong view
was lately forced into sad prominence in the
Coroner's Court:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh p1"><span class="smcap">Dangers of Tea-Drinking</span></p>

<p>"In summing up at a Hackney inquest on
Saturday, Dr. Wynn Westcott, the coroner, commented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
on the fact that deceased, a woman of
twenty-nine, had died suddenly after a meal of
steak, tomatoes, and tea. One of the most injudicious
habits, he said, was to drink tea with a
meat meal. Tea checked the flow of the gastric
juice which was necessary to digestion. He was
sorry if that went against teetotal doctrines, but if
people must be teetotallers they had best drink
water and not tea with their meals."</p>

<p>My present purpose is to enquire whether the
right or the wrong view has more largely predominated
in English history and literature. If, after
the manner of a German commentator, I were
to indulge in "prolegomena" about the history,
statistics, and chemical analysis of Tea, I should
soon overflow my limits; and I regard a painfully
well-known couplet in which "tea" rhymes
with "obey" as belonging to that class of quotations
which no self-respecting writer can again
resuscitate. Perhaps a shade, though only a shade,
less hackneyed is Cowper's tribute to the divine
herb:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">
"Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,<br />
Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,<br />
And, while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn<br />
Throws up a steamy column, and the cups,<br />
That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,<br />
So let us welcome peaceful evening in."</p>

<p class="p1">But this really leaves the problem unsolved.
Cowper drank tea, and drank it in the evening;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
but whether he "had anything with it," as the
phrase is, remains uncertain. Bread and butter,
I think, he must have had, or toast, or what
Thackeray scoffs at as the "blameless muffin";
but I doubt about eggs, and feel quite sure that
he did not mingle meat and tea. So much for
1795, and I fancy that the practice of 1816 (when
"Emma" was published) was not very different.
When Mrs. Bates went to spend the evening
with Mr. Woodhouse there was "vast deal
of chat, and backgammon, and tea was made
downstairs"; but, though the passage is a
little obscure, I am convinced that the "biscuits
and baked apples" were not served with the
tea, but came in later with the ill-fated "fricassee
of sweetbread and asparagus." Lord Beaconsfield,
who was born in 1804, thus describes the
evening meal at "Hurstley"&mdash;a place drawn in
detail from his early home in Buckinghamshire:
"Then they were summoned to tea.... The
curtains were drawn and the room lighted;
an urn hissed; there were piles of bread and
butter, and a pyramid of buttered toast." And,
when the family from the Hall went to tea at the
Rectory, they found "the tea-equipage a picture
of abundance and refinement. Such pretty china,
and such various and delicious cakes! White
bread, and brown bread, and plum cakes, and seed
cakes, and no end of cracknels, and toasts, dry
or buttered." Still here is no mention of animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
foods, and even Dr. Wynn Westcott would have
found nothing to condemn. The same refined
tradition meets us in "Cranford," which, as we all
know from its reference to "Pickwick," describes
the social customs of 1836-7. Mrs. Jameson was
the Queen of Society in Cranford, and, when she
gave a tea-party, the herb was reinforced only by
"very thin bread and butter," and Miss Barker
was thought rather vulgar&mdash;"a tremendous word
in Cranford"&mdash;because she gave seed cake as well.
Even in "Pickwick" itself, though that immortal
book does not pretend to depict the manners of
polite society, the tea served in the sanctum of the
"Marquis of Granby" at Dorking was flanked by
nothing more substantial than a plate of hot
buttered toast.</p>

<p>Impressive, therefore, almost startling, is the
abrupt transition from these ill-supported teas
(which, according to Dr. Wynn Westcott, were
hygienically sound) to the feast, defiant of all gastronomic
law, which Mrs. Snagsby spread for Mr.
and Mrs. Chadband&mdash;"Dainty new bread, crusty
twists, cool fresh butter, thin slices of ham, tongue,
and German sausage, delicate little rows of anchovies
nestling in parsley, new-laid eggs brought
up warm in a napkin, and hot buttered toast."
German sausage washed down with tea! What,
oh what, would the Coroner say? And what
must be the emotions of the waiters at the House
of Commons, with their traditions of Bellamy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
veal pies and Mr. Disraeli's port, when they see
the Labour Members sit down to a refection of
Tea and Brawn? But, it may be urged, Medical
Science is always shifting its ground, and what is
the elixir of life to-day may be labelled Poison
to-morrow. Thus Thackeray, using his keenest
art to stigmatize the unwholesome greediness of
a City Dinner, describes the surfeited guests
adjourning after dinner to the Tea Room, and
there "drinking slops and eating buttered muffins
until the grease trickled down their faces." This
was written in 1847; but in 1823 the great Dr.
Kitchener, both physician and gastronomer, pronounces
thus&mdash;"Tea after Dinner assists Digestion,
quenches Thirst, and thereby exhilarates the
Spirits," and he suggests as an acceptable alternative
"a little warmed Milk, with a teaspoonful
of Rum, a bit of Sugar, and a little Nutmeg."
Truly our forefathers must have had remarkable
digestions.</p>

<p>"These be black Vespers' pageants." I have
spoken so far of Tea in the evening. When did
people begin to drink Tea in the morning? I
seem to remember that, in our earlier romancists
and dramatists, Coffee is the beverage for breakfast.
Certainly it is so&mdash;and inimitably described
as well&mdash;in Lord Beaconsfield's account of a
Yorkshire breakfast in "Sybil." At Holland
House, which was the very ark and sanctuary of
luxury, Macaulay in 1831 breakfasted on "very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
good coffee and very good tea, and very good
eggs, butter kept in the midst of ice, and hot
rolls." Here the two liquids are proffered, but
meat is rigidly excluded, and Dr. Wynn Westcott's
law of life observed. But nine years later the
character of breakfast had altered, and altered
in an unwholesome direction. The increasing
practice of going to Scotland for the shooting
season had familiarized Englishmen with the more
substantial fare of the Scotch breakfast, and since
that time the unhallowed combination of meat
and tea has been the law of our English breakfast-table.
Sir Thomas in the "Ingoldsby Legends,"
on the morning of his mysterious disappearance,
had eaten for breakfast some bacon, an egg, a
little broiled haddock, and a slice of cold beef.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">
"And then&mdash;let me see!&mdash;he had two, perhaps three,<br />
Cups (with sugar and cream) of strong gunpowder tea,<br />
With a spoonful in each of some choice <i>eau de vie</i>,<br />
Which with nine out of ten would perhaps disagree."<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">The same trait may be remembered in the case of
Mrs. Finching, who, though she had cold fowl
and broiled ham for breakfast, "measured out a
spoonful or two of some brown liquid that smelt
like brandy and put it into her tea, saying that she
was obliged to be careful to follow the directions
of her medical man, though the flavour was anything
but agreeable."</p>

<p>Time passes, and the subject expands. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
have spoken of Tea in the morning and Tea in
the evening. To these must be added, if the topic
were to be treated with scientific completeness,
that early cup which opens our eyes, as each new
day dawns, on this world of opportunity and
wonder, and that last dread draught with which
the iron nerves of Mr. Gladstone were composed
to sleep after a late night in the House of
Commons. But I have no space for these divagations,
and must crown this imperfect study of
Tea with the true, though surprising, statement
that I myself&mdash;<i>moi qui vous parle</i>&mdash;have known
the inventor of Five o'Clock Tea. This was Anna
Maria Stanhope, daughter of the third Earl of
Harrington and wife of the seventh Duke of
Bedford. She died at an advanced age&mdash;rouged
and curled and trim to the last&mdash;in 1857; but
not before her life's work was accomplished and
Five o'Clock Tea established among the permanent
institutions of our free and happy country.
Surely she is worthier of a place in the Positivist
Kalendar of those who have benefited Humanity
than Hippocrates, Harvey, or Arkwright; and yet
Sir Algernon West writes thus in his book of
"Recollections": "Late in the 'forties and in the
'fifties, Five o'Clock Teas were just coming into
vogue, the old Duchess of Bedford's being, as I
considered, very dreary festivities." Such is gratitude,
and such is fame.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">SUPPER</p>

<p class="ppi4">"S is the Supper, where all went in pairs;<br />
T is the Twaddle they talked on the stairs."</p>

<p class="p1">Though the merry muse of dear "C. S. C." may
thus serve to introduce our subject, the repast
which he has in view is only a very special and
peculiar&mdash;one had almost said an unnatural&mdash;form
of Supper. The Ball Supper, eaten anywhere
between 12 o'clock and 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, is clearly a
thing apart from the Supper which, in days of
Early Dinner, made England great. Yet the Ball
Supper had its charms, and they have been celebrated
both in prose and in verse. Byron knew
all about them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"I've seen some balls and revels in my time,<br />
And stay'd them over for some silly reason."</p>

<p class="pn1">One of those reasons was the prospect of supping
with Bessie Rawdon,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the only girl he ever saw</p>

<p class="ppi4">"Whose bloom could after dancing dare the dawn."</p>

<p class="pn1">In her society a fresh zest was added to "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
lobster salad, and champagne, and chat" which
the poet loved so well.</p>

<p>Fifty years had passed, and a Ball Supper was
(and for all I know may still be) much the same.
"The bright moments flew on. Suddenly there
was a mysterious silence in the hall, followed by a
kind of suppressed stir. Every one seemed to be
speaking with bated breath, or, if moving, walking
on tiptoe. It was the supper-hour&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">'Soft hour which wakes the wish and melts the heart.'</p>

<p class="pn1">'What a perfect family!' exclaimed Hugo Bohun
as he extracted a couple of fat little birds from
their bed of aspic jelly. 'Everything they do in
such perfect taste! How safe you were here
to have ortolans for supper!'" But, after all,
Ball Suppers are frivolities, and College Suppers
scarcely more serious; although a modern bard
has endeavoured to give them a classical sanction
by making young Horace at the University of
Athens thus address himself to his new acquaintance
Balbus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"A friend has sent me half-a-dozen brace<br />
Of thrush and blackbird from a moor in Thrace.<br />
These we will have for supper, with a dish<br />
Of lobster-patties and a cuttle-fish."</p>

<p class="pn1">And we may be sure that a meal where Horace
was host was not unaccompanied by wine and
song.</p>

<p>But the Supper which I have in mind is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
substantial meal which, during the eighteenth
century and the first quarter of the nineteenth,
formed the nightly complement to the comparatively
early dinner. "High Tea" such as
Dickens loved and described&mdash;"Bagman's Tea,"
as I was taught to call it,&mdash;became popular as
tea became cheaper. You dined, say, at one, and
drank tea (and ate accompaniments) at seven.
But Supper, eaten at nine or ten o'clock, was a
more substantial affair, and the poison of Tea, so
much deprecated by our modern Coroners, was
never suffered to pollute it. In the account of a
supper in 1770 I have read this exhilarating item:
"A turtle was sent as a Present to the Company
and dress'd in a very high <i>Gout</i>, after the West
Indian manner;" and such a dish, eaten at bedtime,
of course required vinous assistance. A
forefather of my own noted in his diary for 1788,
"The man who superintends Mrs. Cazalan's of
New Cavendish Street suppers has a salary of
£100 a year for his trouble;" and one may rest
assured that Mrs. Cazalan's guests drank something
more exhilarating than tea at her famous
supper-table. "Guy Mannering" depicts the habits
of Scotch Society at the close of the eighteenth
century; and Counsellor Pleydell, coming hungry
from a journey, suggests that a brace of wild
ducks should be added to the "light family
supper." These he ate "without prejudice to a
subsequent tart," and with these viands he drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
ale and Burgundy, moralizing thus: "I love the
<i>Coena</i>, the supper of the ancients, the pleasant meal
and social glass that washes out of one's mind
the cobwebs that business or gloom have been
spinning in our brains all day." On the point of
precedent, the Counsellor, or rather Sir Walter
Scott, is at issue with Lord John Russell, who
said, in protesting against dinner at eight o'clock:
"Some learned persons, indeed, endeavour to
support this practice by precedent, and quote the
Roman Supper; but those suppers were at three
o'clock in the afternoon, and ought to be a subject
of contempt instead of imitation in Grosvenor
Square." Supper at three in the afternoon! I
must leave this startling statement to the investigations
of Dryasdust. At the same period as that
at which the Whig Essayist, not yet statesman,
was protesting against late dinners, Sydney Smith
was bewailing the effects of supper on the mind
and temper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friend sups late; he eats some strong
soup, then a lobster, then some tart, and he dilutes
these esculent varieties with wine. The next day
I call upon him. He is going to sell his house in
London and retire into the country. He is
alarmed for his eldest daughter's health. His expenses
are hourly increasing, and nothing but a
timely retreat can save him from ruin. All this
is lobster; and, when over-excited nature has had
time to manage this testaceous incumbrance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
daughter recovers, the finances are in good order,
and every rural idea is effectually excluded from
the mind."</p>

<p>I take due note of the word <i>wine</i>, but I believe
it was usually mixed with water. Of Mr. Pitt,
not a model of abstemiousness, it is recorded that
he drank "a good deal of port wine and water at
supper"; and Mr. Woodhouse, whom his worst
enemy never accused of excess, recommended Mrs.
Goddard to have "<i>half</i> a glass of wine, a <i>small</i>
half-glass, in a tumbler of water," as an accompaniment
to the minced chicken and scalloped
oysters. Dr. Kitchener, who was a practising
physician as well as a writer on Gastronomy, recommended
for Supper "a Biscuit, or a Sandwich,
or a bit of Cold Fowl, and a Glass of Beer, or
Wine, and Toast and Water"; or for "such as
dine very late, Gruel or a little Bread and Cheese,
or Powdered Cheese, and a glass of Beer." They
vaunt that medicine is a progressive science, but
where is the practitioner to-day who would venture
on these heroic prescriptions of 1825?</p>

<p>I am accused of quoting too often from Lord
Beaconsfield; and, though I demur to the word
"too," I admit that I quote from him very often,
because no writer whom I know scanned so carefully
and noted so exactly the social phenomena
of the time in which he lived. Here is his
description of Supper in the year 1835:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When there were cards there was always a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
little supper&mdash;a lobster, and a roasted potato,
and that sort of easy thing, with curious drinks;
and, on fitting occasions, a bottle of champagne
appeared."</p>

<p>The Suppers cooked by the illustrious Ude at
Crockford's Gaming House (now the Devonshire
Club) were famous for their luxurious splendour;
and, being free to all comers, were used as baits
to inveigle ingenuous Youth into the Gambling-room;
for you could scarcely eat a man's supper
night after night and never give him his chance
of revenge. But Suppers to be eaten amid the
frantic excitements of a Gaming House were,
of necessity, rather stimulating than substantial.
For substantial Suppers we must turn to the life
of a class rather less exalted than that which
lost its fortune at "Crocky's". Dickens's Suppers,
which may be taken to represent the supping
habits of the Middle Class in 1837, are substantial
enough, but rather unappetizing. Old Mr. Wardle,
though the most hospitable of men, only gave Mr.
Pickwick "a plentiful portion of a gigantic round
of cold beef"&mdash;which most people would think an
indigestible supper. Mrs. Bardell's system was
even more culpable, according to Dr. Wynn
Westcott, for she gave her friends a little warm
supper of "Petitoes and Toasted Cheese," with "a
quiet cup of tea." I do not exactly know what
petitoes are, but I am sure that when stewed in
tea they must be poisonous. When Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Kenwigs, in honour of their wedding-day, made a
supper for their uncle, the Collector, they arranged
the feast more hygienically, for their "pair of
boiled fowls, large piece of pork, apple-pie, potatoes,
and greens" were reinforced by a bowl of punch;
and there is a quite delicious supper in the "Old
Curiosity Shop," where a stew, worthy to rank
with that which Meg Merrilies forced on the reluctant
Dominie, is washed down with a pint of
mulled ale.</p>

<p>Thackeray, though he excelled at a Dinner, knew
also, at least in his earlier and Bohemian days,
what was meant by a Supper. Mr. Archer, the
journalist in "Pendennis," who was so fond of
vaunting his imaginary acquaintance with great
people, thus described his evening repast at Apsley
House:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Duke knows what I like, and says to the
Groom of the Chambers: 'Martin, you will have
some cold beef, not too much done, and a pint
bottle of Pale Ale, and some brown Sherry ready
in my study as usual.' The Duke doesn't eat
supper himself, but he likes to see a man enjoy a
hearty meal, and he knows that I dine early."</p>

<p>But all this is fifty years ago and more. Do
people eat supper nowadays? Of course the
young and frivolous eat ball-suppers, and supper
after the Theatre is a recognized feature of
London life. But does any one eat supper in his
own house? To be sure, a tray of wine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
water still appears in some houses just as the party
is breaking up, and it is called a "Supper Tray,"
but is only the thin and pallid ghost of what was
once a jolly meal.</p>

<p>One more form of Supper remains to be recorded.
In the circles in which I was reared it
was customary to observe one day in the year
as a kind of Festival of the Church Missionary
Society or the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel, according as the principles of the Incumbent
were Low or High. The arrangements comprised
a special service in church, with a sermon
by that mysterious stranger "the Deputation from
the Parent Society"; an evening meeting in the
Town Hall; and a supper at the Rectory or the
Squire's house. Bidden to such a festival, a friend
of the Missionary cause wrote thus to the lady
who had invited him: "I greatly regret that I
cannot attend the service, and I very much fear
that I shall not be in time for the meeting. But,
<span class="smcap">d.v.</span>, I will be with you at Supper."</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">XXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">INNS AND HOTELS</p>

<p>"Anchovies and Sack after Supper" was honest
Falstaff's notion of an apt sequence. But Anchovies,
even in their modern extension of "Hors
d'&OElig;uvres," will not make a chapter; and Sack, in
the form of Sherry, has been exhaustively discussed.
I must therefore betake myself from
Falstaff to Touchstone, whose enumeration of
"Dinners and Suppers and Sleeping-hours" may
serve my present need.</p>

<p>Where to dine? Where to sup? Where to
sleep? Momentous questions these; and at this
instant they are in the thoughts and on the lips of
thousands of my fellow-creatures as they journey
through or towards London. October in London
is a season with marked and special characteristics.
Restaurants are crowded; Bond Street is blocked
by shopping ladies; seats at the theatre must be
booked ten days in advance.</p>

<p>This October "Season" is the product of many
forces. The genuine Londoners, who have been
away, for health or sport or travel, in August and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
September now come back with a rush, and hasten
to make up for their long exile by feverish activity
in the pursuit of pleasure. But the Londoners
by no means have the town to themselves. The
Country Cousins are present in great force. They
live laborious but delightful days in examining
the winter fashions; they get all their meals at
Prince's or the Carlton; and they go to the
play every night. To these must be added the
Americans, who, having shot our grouse and
stalked our deer and drunk of our medicated
springs, are now passing through London on their
way to Liverpool. As a rule, they buy their
clothes in Paris, and leave the products of Bond
Street and Grafton Street to the British consumer.
But their propensity to Theatre-parties
and Suppers endears them to managers and
restaurant-keepers; and on Sunday they can be
detected at St. Paul's or the Abbey, rendering the
hymns with that peculiar intonation for which
Chaucer's "Prioresse" was so justly admired.
Even a few belated French and German tourists
are still wandering disconsolately among "the
sheddings of the pining umbrage" in the parks, or
gazing with awe at the grim front of Buckingham
Palace. Where do all these pilgrims stay? We
know where they dine and sup; but where do
they spend what Touchstone called their "sleeping-hours"?
I only know that they do not spend
them in Inns, for Inns as I understand the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
have ceased to exist. They went out with "The
Road."</p>

<p>It has been remarked by not unfriendly critics
that the author of these quiet meditations seems
to live a good deal in the past, and people in
whom the chronological sense is missing are apt
to think me a great deal older than I am. Thus
when I have recalled among my earliest recollections
the fire which destroyed Covent Garden
Theatre (in 1856), I have been thought to be
babbling of Drury Lane, which was burnt down
in 1812; and so, when I say that in early life I
travelled a great deal upon the Road, I shall
probably be accused of having been born before
railways were invented. What is true enough is
that a prejudice against railways lingered long
after they were in general use; some people
thought them dangerous, some undignified, and
I believe that there were some who even thought
them wicked because they are not mentioned in
the Bible. "I suppose you have heard of Lady
Vanilla's trip from Birmingham?" says Lady
Marney in "Sybil." "Have you not, indeed?
She came up with Lady Laura, and two of the
most gentlemanlike men sitting opposite her;
never met, she says, two more intelligent men.
She begged one of them at Wolverhampton to
change seats with her, and he was most politely
willing to comply with her wishes, only it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
necessary that his companion should move at the
same time, for they were chained together&mdash;two
gentlemen sent to town for picking pockets at
Shrewsbury races." "A Countess and a felon!"
said Lord Mowbray. "So much for public conveyances."
To these social perils were added
terrors of tunnels, terrors of viaducts, terrors of
fires which would burn you to an ash in your
locked carriage, terrors of robbers who were supposed
to travel first-class for the express purpose
of chloroforming well-dressed passengers and then
stealing their watches. Haunted by these and
similar fears, some old-fashioned people travelled
by road till well into the 'sixties. From my home
in the South Midlands we took a whole day
in getting to London, forty miles off; two to
Leamington, three to Winchester; and those who
still travelled in this leisurely mode were the last
patrons of the Inn.</p>

<p>It was generally a broad-browed, solid, comfortable-looking
house in the most central part of
a country town. Not seldom the sign was taken
from the armorial bearings of the local magnate.
There were a Landlord and a Landlady, who came
out bowing when the carriage drove up, and conducted
the travellers to their rooms, while the
"Imperials" were taken down from the roof of
the carriage. (Could one buy an "Imperial"
nowadays if one wanted it? The most recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
reference to it which I can recall occurs in the
first chapter of "Tom Brown's School Days.")
Very often the rooms of the Inn were distinguished
not by numbers, but by names or tokens derived
from the situation, or the furniture, or from some
famous traveller who had slept in them&mdash;the Bow
Room, the Peacock Room, or the Wellington
Room. The Landlord had generally been a
butler, but sometimes a coachman. Anyhow, he
and his wife had "lived in the best families" and
"knew how things ought to be done." The furniture
was solid, dark, and handsome&mdash;mahogany
predominating, here and there relieved with rosewood.
There was old silver on the table, and the
walls were covered with sporting or coaching
prints, views of neighbouring castles, and portraits
of the Nobility whom the Landlord had served.
The bedrooms were dark and stuffy beyond belief,
with bedsteads like classic temples and deep
feather-beds into which you sank as into a quicksand.
The food was like the furniture, heavy and
handsome. There was "gunpowder tea"&mdash;green
if you asked for it,&mdash;luscious cream, and really
new-laid eggs. The best bottle of claret which I
ever encountered emerged, quite accidentally, from
the cellar of a village Inn close to the confluence
of the Greta and the Tees, in a district hallowed
by the associations of Rokeby and Mr. Squeers.
When, next morning, you had paid your bill&mdash;not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
as a rule, a light one&mdash;the Landlord and
Lady escorted you to the door, and politely expressed
a hope that you would honour them on
your return journey. Then "Hey, for the lilt of
the London road!" and the Montfort Arms, or
the Roebuck, or the Marquis of Granby, is only a
pleasant memory of an unreturning day.</p>

<p>What in the country was called an Inn was
called in London a "Family Hotel." It was
commonly found in Dover Street, or Albemarle
Street, or Bolton Street, or some such byway
of Piccadilly; and in its aspect, character, and
general arrangement it was exactly like the country
Inn, only of necessity darker, dingier, and more
airless. Respectability, mahogany, and horse-hair
held it in their iron grip. Here county families,
coming up from the Drawing Room, or the
Academy, or the Exhibition, or the Derby, spent
cheerful weeks in summer. Here in the autumn
they halted on their return from Doncaster or
Aix. Here the boys slept on their way back
to Eton or Cambridge; hither the subaltern
returned, like a homing pigeon, from India or
the Cape.</p>

<p>But the Family Hotel, like the Country Inn,
has seen its day. When the <i>Times</i> was inciting
the inhabitants of Rome to modernize their city,
Matthew Arnold, writing in Miss Story's album,
made airy fun of the suggestion. He represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
"the <i>Times</i>, that bright Apollo," proclaiming salvation
to the "armless Cupid" imprisoned in the
Vatican:&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"'And what,' cries Cupid, 'will save us?'<br />
Says Apollo: '<i>Modernize Rome!</i></p>
<p class="pin4">What inns! Your streets too, how narrow!<br />
Too much of palace and dome!'</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"'O learn of London, whose paupers<br />
Are not pushed out by the swells!</p>
<p class="pin4">Wide streets, with fine double trottoirs;<br />
And then&mdash;the London hotels!'"</p>

<p class="p1">Between the "Inns" of my youth and these
"Hotels" of to-day the difference is so great that
they can scarcely be recognized as belonging to
the same family. Under the old dispensation all
was solid comfort, ponderous respectability, and
the staid courtesy of the antique world; under
the new it is all glare and glitter, show and sham;
the morals of the Tuileries and the manners of
Greenwich Fair. The building is something
between a palace and a barrack, with a hall of
marble, a staircase of alabaster, a winter garden
full of birds and fountains, and a band which
deafens you while you eat your refined but exiguous
dinner. Among these sumptuosities the
visitor is no longer a person but a number. As
a number he is received by the gigantic "Suisse"
who, resplendent in green and gold, watches the
approach to the palace; as a number he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
registered by a dictatorial "Secretary," enshrined
in a Bureau; as a number he is shot up, like a
parcel, to his airy lodgings on the seventh floor;
as a number he orders his meals; as a number
he pays his bill. The whole business is a microcosm
of State Socialism: Bureaucracy is supreme,
and the Individual is lost in the Machine. But,
though the courtesies and the humanities and even
the decencies of the old order have vanished so
completely, the exactions remain much the same
as they were. There is, indeed, no courtly landlord
to bow, like a plumper Sir Charles Grandison,
over the silver salver on which you have laid
your gold; but there are gilt-edged porters, and
moustached lift-men, and a regiment of buttony
boys who float round the departing guest with
well-timed assiduity; and the Suisse at the door,
as he eyes our modest luggage with contemptuous
glare, looks quite prepared, if need be, to extort
his guerdon by physical force.</p>

<p>The British Inn, whatever were its shortcomings
in practice, has been glorified in some of the best
verse and best prose in the English language. It
will, methinks, be a long time before even the
most impressionable genius of the "Bodley Head"
pens a panegyric of the London Hotel.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">TRAVEL</p>

<p>The October Season, of which I lately spoke, is
practically over. "The misty autumn sunlight
and the sweeping autumn wind" are yielding
place to cloud and storm. In a week's time
London will have assumed its winter habit,
and already people are settling down to their
winter way of living. The last foreigner has fled.
The Country Cousins have finished their shopping
and have returned to the pursuit of the Pheasant
and the Fox. The true Londoners&mdash;the people
who come back to town for the "first note of the
Muffin-bell and retreat to the country for the
first note of the Nightingale"&mdash;have resumed the
placidity of their normal life. Dinner-parties have
hardly begun, but there are plenty of little
luncheons; the curtains are drawn about four,
and there are three good hours for Bridge before
one need think of going to dress for dinner. And
now, just when London is beginning to wear once
again its most attractive aspect, at once sociable
and calm, some perverse people, disturbers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
public peace, must needs throw everything into
confusion by going abroad.</p>

<p>Their motives are many and various. With
some it is health: "I feel that I <i>must</i> have a
little sunshine, I have been so rheumatic all this
autumn," or "My doctor tells me that, with my
tendency to bronchitis, the fogs are really dangerous."
With some it is sheer restlessness: "Well,
you see, we were here <i>all</i> the summer, except just
Whitsuntide and Ascot and Goodwood; so we
have had about enough of London. And our
home in Loamshire is so fearfully lonely in winter
that it quite gets on my nerves. So I think a
little run will do us all good; and we shall be
back by the New Year, or February at latest."
With some, again, economy is the motive power;
"What with two sons to allowance, and two still
at school; and one girl to be married at Easter,
and one just coming out, as well as a most
expensive governess for the young ones, I assure
you it is quite difficult to make two ends meet.
We have got an excellent offer for Eaton Place
from November to May, and some friends on the
Riviera have repeatedly asked us to pay them a
long visit; and, when that's done, one can live <i>en
pension</i> at Montreux for next to nothing." Others
are lured abroad by the love of gambling, though
this is not avowed: "I do so love Monte Carlo&mdash;not
the gambling, but the air, and, even if one does
lose a franc or two at the tables, I always say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that we should lose much more at home, with
Christmas presents, and Workhouse Treats, and
all those tiresome things one has to do."</p>

<p>It is not a joke&mdash;for I never joke about religion&mdash;it
is a literal fact that in my youth the prophecy
in the Book of Daniel that "Many shall run to
and fro, and knowledge shall be increased" was
interpreted as pointing to an enlargement of the
human mind through increased facilities of travel.
I do not guarantee the exegesis, but I note the
fact. A hundred years ago, if parents wished to
enlarge their son's understanding by sending him
on the "Grand Tour" of Europe, they set aside
twelve months for the fulfilment of their purpose.
Young Hopeful set out in a travelling-carriage
with a tutor (or Bear-Leader), a Doctor, and a
Valet. The Bear-Leader's was a recognized and
lucrative profession. In a diary for 1788, which
lies before me as I write, I read: "Mr. Coxe, the
traveller, has been particularly lucky as a Pupil-Leader
about Europe. After Lord Herbert, he
had Mr. Whitbred at £800 per ann., and now
has Mr. Portman, with £1000 per ann." Patrick
Brydone, scholar, antiquary, and <i>virtuoso</i>, whose
daughter married the second Earl of Minto, was
"Pupil-Leader" (or Bear-Leader) to William Beckford.
Sydney Smith was dug out of his curacy on
Salisbury Plain in order to act as Bear-Leader to
the grandfather of the present Lord St. Aldwyn.
Charles Richard Sumner, who, as last of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Prince-Bishops of Winchester, drew £40,000 a
year for forty years, began life as Bear-Leader to
Lord Mount-Charles, eldest son of that Lady
Conyngham whom George IV. admired; and he
owed his first preferment in the Church to the
amiable complaisance with which he rescued his
young charge from a matrimonial entanglement.
That was early in the nineteenth century; but
forty years later the Bear-Leader was still an
indispensable adjunct to the Grand Tour of
Illustrious Youth. The late Duke of Argyll has
told us how he made his travels sandwiched inside
his father's chariot between his preceptor and
his physician. When the Marquis of Montacute
made his pilgrimage to the Holy Land he was
even more liberally attended; for, in addition to
his Bear-Leader, Colonel Grouse, he took his
father's doctor, Mr Groby, to avert or cure the
fevers, and his father's chaplain, the Rev. Mr.
Bernard, to guide his researches into the theology
of Syria. Perhaps Lord Montacute existed only
in Lord Beaconsfield's rich imagination; but
Thackeray, who never invented but always described
what he saw, drew a delightful portrait of
"the Rev. Baring Leader," who, "having a great
natural turn and liking towards the aristocracy,"
consented to escort Viscount Talboys when that
beer-loving young nobleman made his celebrated
journey down the Rhine.</p>

<p>But, though a special divinity always hedged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
as it still hedges, the travels of an Eldest Son, the
more modest journeyings of his parents were not
accomplished without considerable form and fuss.
Lord and Lady Proudflesh or Mr. and Mrs. Goldmore
travelled all over Europe in their own
carriage. It was planted bodily on the deck of
the steamer, so that its privileged occupants could
endure the torments of the crossing in dignified
seclusion; and, when once the solid shore of the
Continent was safely reached, it was drawn by an
endless succession of post-horses, ridden by postillions,
with the valet and maid (like those who
pertained to Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock)
"affectionate in the rumble." The inside of the
carriage was a miracle of ingenuity. Space was
economized with the most careful art, and all the
appliances of travel&mdash;looking-glasses and luncheon-baskets,
lamps and maps, newspapers and books&mdash;were
bestowed in their peculiar and appropriate
corners. I possess a "dining equipage" which
made the tour of Europe not once but often in
the service of a Diplomatist. It is shaped something
like a large egg, and covered with shagreen.
It contains a tumbler, a sandwich-box, and a
silver-handled knife, fork, and spoon; the handle
of each of these tools unscrews, and in their
hollow interiors the Diplomatist carried his salt,
sugar, and pepper. On the roof of the carriage
was the more substantial luggage. A travelling-bath,
though not unknown, was rather an exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
luxury, and, according to our modern
notions, it was painfully small. A silver tub which
sufficed for the ablutions of the great Duke of
Marlborough through the campaigns which changed
the face of Europe now serves as a rose-bowl at
the banquets of Spencer House.</p>

<p>The trunks, which were strapped to the roof of
the travelling-carriage, were of a peculiar form&mdash;very
shallow, and so shaped as to fit into one
another and occupy every inch of space. These
were called Imperials, and just now I referred to
Tom Hughes's undeserved strictures on them.
The passage fits neatly into our present subject: "I
love vagabonds, only I prefer poor to rich ones.
Couriers and ladies' maids, imperials and travelling-carriages,
are an abomination unto me&mdash;I cannot
away with them." To me, on the contrary, the
very word "Imperial" (when divested of political
associations) is pleasant. It appeals to the historic
sense. It carries us back to Napoleon's campaigns,
and to that wonderful house on wheels&mdash;his travelling-carriage&mdash;now
enshrined at Madame Tussaud's.
It even titillates the gastronomic instinct
by recalling that masterly method of cooking a
fowl which bears the name of Marengo. The
great Napoleon had no notion of fighting his
battles on an empty stomach, so, wherever he
was, a portable kitchen, in the shape of a travelling-carriage,
was close at hand. The cook and
his <i>marmitons</i> travelled inside, with the appliances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for making a charcoal fire at a moment's notice,
while the Imperials on the roof contained the due
supply of chickens, eggs, bread, and Bordeaux. In
the preparation of a meal under such conditions
time was money&mdash;nay, rather, it was Empire.
The highest honours were bestowed on the most
expeditious method, and the method called after
Marengo took exactly twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Here is testimony much more recent. Lady
Dorothy Nevill, in the volume of "Reminiscences"
which she has lately given to the world, thus
describes her youthful journeys between her
London and her Norfolk homes: "It took us two
long days to get to Wolterton, and the cost must
have been considerable. We went in the family
coach with four post-horses, whilst two 'fourgons'
conveyed the luggage." But travelling abroad
was a still more majestic ceremonial: "We were
a large party&mdash;six of ourselves, as well as two
maids, a footman, and French cook; nor must I
forget a wonderful courier, covered with gold
and braid. He preceded our cavalcade and announced
the imminent arrival of a great English
Milord and his suite. We had two fourgons to
hold the <i>batterie de cuisine</i> and our six beds,
which had to be unpacked and made up every
night. We had, besides the family coach and a
barouche, six saddle horses, and two attendant
grooms."</p>

<p>Travel in those brave days of old was a dignified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
a leisurely, and a comfortable process. How
different is Travel in these degenerate times!
For the young man rejoicing in his strength it
means, as Tom Hughes said forty years ago,
"getting over a couple of thousand miles for three-pound-ten;
going round Ireland, with a return
ticket, in a fortnight; dropping your copy of
Tennyson on the top of a Swiss mountain, or
pulling down the Danube in an Oxford racing-boat."
For those who have reached maturer
years it may mean a couple of nights in Paris, just
to see the first performance of a new play and to
test the merits of the latest restaurant, or it may
mean a week in New York to study the bearings
of the Presidential election and to gather fresh
views of the Silver Question. Dr. Lunn kindly
invites the more seriously minded to a Conference
at Grindelwald, where we can combine the delights
of Alpine scenery and undenominational religion;
and "the son of a well-known member of the
House of Lords" offers to conduct us personally
through "A Lion and Rhinoceros Hunting
Party in Somaliland," or "A Scientific Expedition
to Central Africa, to visit the supposed cradle
of the human race and the site of the Garden of
Eden." Nothing of Travelling-carriages and Imperials
here! No "maid and valet affectionate
in the rumble." All the pomp and circumstance,
all the ease and calm, of Travel have vanished,
and with them all sense of independence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
responsibility. The modern traveller is shot like
a bullet through a tunnel, or hauled like a parcel
up a hill. He certainly sees the world at very
little cost, but he sees it under wonderfully uncomfortable
conditions.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">ACCOMPLISHMENTS</p>

<p>A pictorial critic, commending the water-colour
painting of Mr. Arthur Rich, says that, after
examining his firm and serious work, "it is impossible
to think that there is anything trivial in
the art of Aquarelle&mdash;that it is, as has been said,
'a thing Aunts do.'"</p>

<p><i>A thing Aunts do.</i> I linger on the words, for
they suggest deep thoughts. Many and mysterious
are the tricks of language&mdash;not least so the subtle
law by which certain relationships inevitably suggest
peculiar traits. Thus the Grandmother stands
to all time as the type of benevolent feebleness;
the Stepmother was branded by classical antiquity
as Unjust; and Thackeray's Mrs. Gashleigh and
Mrs. Chuff are the typical Mothers-in-Law. The
Father is commonly the "Heavy Father" of fiction
and the drama. The Mother is always quoted
with affection, as in "Mother-wit," our Mother-country,
and our Mother-tongue. "A Brother,"
ever since the days of Solomon, "is born for
adversity," and a Brother-officer implies a loyal
friend. A Sister is the type of Innocence, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
just a faint tinge or <i>nuance</i> of pitying contempt,
as when the Vainglorious Briton speaks of the
"Sister Country" across St. George's Channel, or
the hubristic Oxonian sniggers at the "Sister University"
of Cambridge. Eldest and Younger Sons
again, as I have before now had occasion to point
out, convey two quite different sets of ideas, and
this discrepancy has not escaped the notice of the
social Poet, who observes that&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Acres and kine and tenements and sheep<br />
Enrich the Eldest, while the Younger Sons<br />
Monopolize the talents and the duns."</p>

<p class="pn1">"My Uncle," in colloquial phrase, signifies the
merchant who transacts his business under the
sign of the Three Golden Balls; and to these
expressive relationships must be added Auntship.
"A thing Aunts do," says the pictorial critic; and
the contumelious phrase is not of yesterday, for
in 1829 a secularly-minded friend complained
that young Mr. William Gladstone, then an Undergraduate
at Christ Church, had "mixed himself
up so much with the St. Mary Hall and Oriel set,
who are really, for the most part, only fit to live
with maiden aunts and keep tame rabbits." To
paint in water-colour and to keep tame rabbits
are pursuits which to the superficial gaze have
little in common, though both are, or were,
characteristic of Aunts, and both are, in some
sense, accomplishments, demanding natural taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
acquired skill, patience, care, a delicate touch, and
a watchful eye. Perhaps these were the particular
accomplishments in which the traditional Aunt
"specialized," though she had never heard that
bad word; but, if she chose to diffuse her energies
more widely, the world was all before her where to
choose; and, by a singular reversal of the law of
progress, there were more "accomplishments" to
solicit her attention a hundred years ago than there
are to-day.</p>

<p>When the most fascinating of all heroines, Di
Vernon, anticipated posterity by devoting her
attention to politics, field sports, and classical literature,
she enumerated, among the more feminine
accomplishments which she had discarded, "sewing
a tucker, working cross-stitch, and making a
pudding"; and she instanced, among the symbols
of orthodox femininity "a shepherdess wrought in
worsted, a broken-backed spinet, a lute with three
strings, rock-work, shell-work, and needle-work."
We clear the century with a flying leap, and
find ourselves in the company of a model matron,
with surroundings substantially unchanged: "Mrs.
Bayham-Badger was surrounded in the drawing-room
by various objects indicative of her painting
a little, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar
a little, playing the harp a little, singing a little,
working a little, reading a little, writing poetry a
little, and botanizing a little. If I add to the little
list of her accomplishments that she rouged a little,
I do not mean that there was any harm in it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Miss Volumnia Dedlock's accomplishments, though
belonging to the same period, were slightly different:
"Displaying in early life a pretty talent
for cutting ornaments out of coloured paper, and
also singing to the guitar in the Spanish tongue
and propounding French conundrums in country
houses, she passed the twenty years of her existence
between twenty and forty in a sufficiently
agreeable manner. Lapsing then out of date, and
being considered to bore mankind by her vocal
performances in the Spanish language, she retired
to Bath." Perhaps she had been educated by
Miss Monflathers, "who was at the head of the
head Boarding and Day Establishment in the
town," and whose gloss on the didactic ditty of
the Busy Bee so confounded the emissary from
the Waxworks.</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"In books, or work, or healthful play</p>

<p class="pn1">is quite right as far as genteel children are concerned,
and in their case 'work' means painting on
velvet, fancy needle-work, or embroidery." Do
even Aunts paint on velvet, or cut ornaments out
of coloured paper, in this "so-called Twentieth
Century"? I know no more pathetic passage in
the Literature of Art than that in which Mrs.
Gaskell enumerated Miss Matty's qualifications for
the work of teaching:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ran over her accomplishments. Once upon
a time I had heard her say she could play 'Ah!
vous dirai-je maman?' on the piano; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was long, long ago; that faint shadow of musical
acquirement had died out years before. She had
also once been able to trace patterns very nicely
for muslin embroidery, but that was her nearest
approach to the accomplishment of drawing, and
I did not think it would go very far. Miss
Matty's eyes were failing her, and I doubted if
she could discover the number of threads in a
worsted-work pattern, or rightly appreciate the
different shades required for Queen Adelaide's
face, in the loyal wool-work now fashionable in
Cranford."</p>

<p>The allusion to Queen Adelaide's face fixes the
narrative between 1820 and 1830, and George Eliot
was depicting the same unenlightened period when
she described the accomplishments provided by
Ladies' Schools as "certain small tinklings and
smearings." Probably all of us can recall an Aunt
who tinkled on the piano, or a First Cousin once
Removed who smeared on Bristol Board. Lady
Dorothy Nevill, whose invincible force and evergreen
memory carry down into the reign of King
Edward VII. the traditions of Queen Charlotte's
Court, is a singularly accomplished Aunt, and she
has just made this remarkable confession: "At
different times I have attempted many kinds of
amateur work, including book illumination, leather-working,
wood-carving, and, of late years, a kind
of old-fashioned paper-work, which consists in
arranging little slips of coloured paper into decorative
designs, as was done at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
eighteenth century. When completed, this work
is made up into boxes, trays, or mounts for
pictures." Surely in this accomplishment Miss
Volumnia Dedlock lives again. And then Lady
Dorothy, lapsing into reminiscent vein, makes
this rather half-hearted apology for the domestic
artistry of bygone days: "Years ago ladies used to
spend much more of their time in artistic work of
some kind or other, for there were not then the
many distractions which exist to-day. Indeed, in
the country some sort of work was a positive
necessity; and though, no doubt, by far the
greater portion of what was done was absolutely
hideous, useless, and horrible, yet it served the
purpose of passing away many an hour which
otherwise would have been given up to insufferable
boredom."</p>

<p>Yes, the fashions of the world succeed one
another in perpetual change; but Boredom is
eternally the enemy, and the paramount necessity
of escaping from it begets each year some new and
strange activity. The Aunt no longer paints in
water-colours or keeps tame rabbits, flattens ferns
in an album, or traces crude designs with a hot
poker on a deal board. To-day she urges the
impetuous bicycle, or, in more extreme cases,
directs the murderous motor; lectures on politics
or platonics, Icelandic art, or Kamschatkan literature.
Perhaps she has a Cause or a Mission
pleads for the legal enforcement of Vegetarian
Boots, or tears down the knocker of a Statesman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
who refuses her the suffrage. Perhaps her enthusiasms
are less altruistic, and then she may
pillage her friends at Bridge, or supply the <i>New
York Sewer</i> with a weekly column of Classy Cuttings.
"Are you the <i>Daily Mail</i>?" incautiously
chirped a literary lady to an unknown friend who
had rung her up on the telephone. "No, I'm not,

and so, in truth, she was.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXIX</h2>

<p class="pch">CIDER</p>

<p>An ingenious correspondent of mine has lately
been visiting the Brewers' Exhibition, and has
come away from it full of Cider. I mean "full"
in the intellectual rather than the physical sense&mdash;full
of the subject, though unversed in the
beverage. He reminds me that Charles Lamb had
his catalogue of "Books which are no books&mdash;<i>biblia
a-biblia</i>," among which he reckoned Court
Calendars, Directories, Pocket-books, Draughtboards
bound and lettered on the back, Scientific
Treatises, Almanacs, Statutes at Large, and Paley's
Moral Philosophy. My correspondent suggests that,
in a like spirit, a Brewer must have his catalogue
of Drinks which are no drinks&mdash;<i>pota a-pota</i>&mdash;and
that among them, if only the secret thoughts of his
heart were known, he must reckon Cider. Yet at
the Brewers' Exhibition there was a Literature of
Cider, and that innocent-sounding beverage was
quoted at a price per bottle at which Claret is not
ashamed to be sold. That the men of Malt and
Hops should thus officially recognize the existence
of fermented apple-juice strikes my friend as an
Economy of Truth; a suppression, or at least an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
evasion, of a deep-seated and absolute belief. They
cannot really regard Cider as a drink, and yet they
give it a place alongside that manly draught which
has made old England what she is. I, on the other
hand, who always like to regard the actions of my
fellow-men in the most favourable light, prefer to
think that the Brewers have been employing some
portion of that enforced leisure, which the decay
of their industry must have brought, in studying
English literature, and that they have thus been
made acquainted with the name and fame of Cider.</p>

<p><i>Biblia a-biblia</i> set me thinking of Lamb, and
when once one begins recalling "Elia" one drifts
along, in a kind of waking reverie, from one
pleasant fantasy to another. <i>Biblia a-biblia</i> led
me on to "Dream Children," and Dream Children
to Dream Riddles&mdash;a reverie of my own childhood,
when we used to ask one another a pleasing
conundrum which played prettily on <i>In Cider</i> and
<i>Inside her</i>. But it made light of an illustrious
name and had better be forgotten.</p>

<p>Few, I fear, are the readers of John Philips, but,
if such there be, they will no doubt recall the only
poem which, as far as I know, has ever been devoted
to the praise of Apple-wine. Philips was a
patriotic son of Herefordshire, and in Hereford
Cathedral he lies buried under bunches of marble
apples which commemorate his poetical achievement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">
"What soil the apple loves, what care is due<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>To Orchats, timeliest when to press the fruits,<br />
Thy gift, Pomona! in Miltonian verse,<br />
Adventurous, I presume to sing; of verse<br />
Nor skill'd nor studious; but my native soil<br />
Invites me, and the theme as yet unsung."</p>

<p class="p1">"Orchats" is good; but how far these lines can
be justly called Miltonian is a question which my
readers can decide for themselves. At any rate,
the poem contains more than four thousand lines
exactly like them, and they had the remarkable
fortune to be translated into Italian under the
title of "Il Sidro." Philips was a Cavalier in all
his tastes and sympathies: but even the Puritans,
whom he so cordially detested, admitted the merits
of Cider. Macaulay, with his characteristic love of
irrelevant particularity, insists on the fact that,
through all the commotions of the Great Rebellion
and the Civil War, "the cream overflowed the pails
of Cheshire and the apple-juice foamed in the
presses of Herefordshire." Nor was it only in his
purple prose that the great rhetorician glorified the
juice of the apple. Many a reader who has forgotten
all about John Philips will recall Macaulay's
rhymes on the garrulous country squire who had a
habit of detaining people by the button, and who
was especially addicted to the society of Bishops:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"His Grace Archbishop Manners-Sutton<br />
Could not keep on a single button.<br />
As for Right Reverend John of Chester,<br />
His waistcoats open at the breasts are.<br />
Our friend has filled a mighty trunk<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>With trophies torn from Bishop Monk,<br />
And he has really tattered foully<br />
The vestments of good Bishop Howley.<br />
No buttons could I late discern on<br />
The garments of Archbishop Vernon,<br />
And never had his fingers mercy<br />
Upon the garb of Bishop Percy;<br />
While buttons fly from Bishop Ryder<br />
Like corks that spring from bottled cyder."</p>

<p class="p1">From Macaulay and bottled Cyder (or Cider) the
transition is easy to that admirable delineator of
life and manners, Mrs. Sherwood; she was pretty
much a contemporary of Macaulay's, and was a
native of Worcestershire, which in its Cider-bearing
qualities is not far removed from Herefordshire,
beloved of Philips. Few but fit is the audience to
which Mrs. Sherwood still appeals; yet they who
were nurtured on "The Fairchild Family" still
renew their youth as they peruse the adventures of
Lucy, Emily, and little Henry: "The farmer and
his wife, whose name was Freeman, were not
people who lived in the fear of God, neither did
they bring up their children well; on which account
Mr. Fairchild had often forbidden Lucy,
Emily, and Henry to go to their house." However,
go they did, as soon as their parents' backs were
turned; and Mrs. Freeman "gave them each a large
piece of cake and something sweet to drink, which,
she said, would do them good." But it turned out
to be Cider, and did not do them good, for, "as
they were never used to drink anything but water,
it made them quite drunk for a little while."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The mention of Worcestershire as a cider-growing
county aptly introduces my unfailing friend
Lord Beaconsfield, for, though he is less precise
than I could wish in praise of Cider, he compliments
it indirectly in his pretty description
of "a fair child, long-haired, and blushing like
a Worcestershire orchard before harvest-time."
Once, indeed, the lover of Disraelitish romance
seems to find himself on the track of Cider.
Harry Coningsby is overtaken by a thunderstorm
in a forest, and, taking refuge in a sylvan inn,
makes friends with a mysterious stranger. The
two travellers agree to dine together, when this
eminently natural dialogue ensues. "'But Ceres
without Bacchus,' said Coningsby, 'how does that
do? Think you, under this roof, we could invoke
the god?'</p>

<p>"'Let us swear by his body that we will try,'
said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Alas! the landlord was not a priest of Bacchus.
But then these enquiries led to the finest Perry in
the world." If only the Perry had been Cider,
this quotation had been more apposite; but the
themes, though not identical, are cognate.</p>

<p>We have traced the praise of Cider in poetry and
in romance, but it also has its place in biography,
and even in religious biography. One of the most
delightful portraits of a saint which was ever drawn
is Mrs. Oliphant's "Life of Edward Irving." In
the autumn of 1834&mdash;the last autumn of his life&mdash;that
Prophet and man of God made a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
apostolic journey through Shropshire, Herefordshire,
and Wales. From Kington, in Herefordshire,
he wrote to his wife: "My dinner was ham and
eggs, a cold fowl, an apple tart, and cheese; a
tumbler of Cider, and a glass of Sicilian Tokay."
And he adds a tender reference to "Ginger Wine
in a long-necked decanter." It is always satisfactory
to find the good things of this life not
reserved exclusively for bad people.</p>

<p>Sydney Smith, though a Canon of St. Paul's,
was scarcely a Saint and not at all a Prophet;
and through the study-windows of his beautiful
parsonage in Somersetshire, he gazed on the
glories of the Cider-vintage with an eye more
mundane than that of Edward Irving. In 1829 he
wrote from Combe Florey&mdash;"the sacred valley of
flowers," as he loved to call it: "I continue to be
delighted with the country. The harvest is got in
without any rain. The Cider is such an enormous
crop that it is sold at ten shillings a hogshead; so
a human creature may lose his reason for a penny."</p>

<p>Cider is, I believe, still drunk at Oxford; and
memory retains grateful recollections of Cider-cup
beautiful as a liquid topaz, with a cluster of blue
flowers floating on its breast. But the Cider-Cellars
of London&mdash;places of, I fear, ill-regulated conviviality&mdash;have,
as far as I know, long since closed
their doors. Yet they, too, have their secure place
in literature. The "Young Lion" of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, who looked forward to succeeding
Dr. W. H. Russell as War Correspondent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
<i>Times</i>, thrilled with excitement at the prospect
of inoculating the Leading Journal with "the
divine madness of our new style&mdash;the style we
have formed upon Sala. It blends the airy epicureanism
of the <i>salons</i> of Augustus with the full-bodied
gaiety of our English Cider Cellar." But
that was written in 1870, and the style and the
Cellars alike are things of the past. The official
historian of Cider excels in that "dry light" which
is the grace of history, and gravely tells us that
"Cider (<i>Zider</i>, German) when first made in England
was called wine." With a proper reluctance to
commit himself to what is antecedently incredible,
he adds that "the Earl of Manchester, when Ambassador
in France (1699), <i>is said</i> to have passed
off Cider for Wine." It is more plausibly stated
that in later days the innocuous apple has been
artfully mingled with the "foaming grape of
Eastern France," and has been drunk in England
as Champagne. The Hock-cup at Buckingham
Palace is justly vaunted as one of the chief glories
of our ancient polity. It is certainly the most
delectable drink that ever refreshed a thirsty soul;
and the art of concocting it is a State-Secret of the
most awful solemnity. But there never was a
secret which did not sooner or later elude its
guardians; and I have heard that a Royal cellarer,
in an expansive moment, once revealed the spell.
German Wine and English Cider together constitute
the Kingly Cup,</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"And, blended, form, with artful strife,<br />
The strength and harmony of life."</p>

<p class="pch">THE GARTER</p>

<p class="ppi4">"Breathes there a man, with soul so dead,<br />
Who never to himself hath said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">I should uncommonly like to be a Knight of the
Garter?" If such there be, let him forswear this
column and pass on to the Cotton Market or the
Education Bill. Here we cater for those in whom
the historic instinct is combined with picturesque
sensibility, and who love to trace the stream of
the national life as it flows through long-descended
rites. Lord Acton wrote finely of "Institutions
which incorporate tradition and prolong the reign
of the dead." No institution fulfils this ideal more
absolutely than the Order of the Garter. One
need not always "commence with the Deluge";
and there is no occasion to consult the lively
oracles of Mrs. Markham for the story of the
dropped garter and the chivalrous motto. It is
enough to remember that the Order links the last
enchantments of the Middle Age with the Twentieth
Century, and that for at least four hundred years
it has played a real, though hidden, part in the
secret strategy of English Statecraft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>We are told by travellers that the Emperor of
Lilliput rewarded his courtiers with three fine
silken threads of about six inches long, one of
which was blue, one red, and one green. The
method by which these rewards were obtained
is thus described by an eye-witness: "The Emperor
holds a stick in his hands, both ends parallel
to the horizon, while the candidates, advancing
one by one, sometimes leap over it, sometimes
creep under it, backwards and forwards, several
times, according as the stick is elevated or depressed.
Whoever shows the most agility and
performs his part best of leaping and creeping is
rewarded with the blue coloured silk, the next
with the red, and so on."</p>

<p>To-day we are not concerned with the red silk,
wisely invented by Sir Robert Walpole for the
benefit of those who could not aspire to the blue;
nor with the green, which illustrates the continuous
and separate polity of the Northern Kingdom.
The blue silk supplies us with all the material we
shall need. In its wider aspect of the Blue
Ribbon, it has its secure place in the art, the
history, and the literature of England; though
perhaps the Dryasdusts of future ages will be
perplexed by the Manichæan associations which
will then have gathered round it. "When," they
will ask, "and by what process, did the ensign of
a high chivalric Order which originated at a
banquet become the symbol of total abstinence
from fermented drinks?" Even so, a high-toned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
damsel from the State of Maine, regarding the
Blue Ribbon which girt Lord Granville's white
waistcoat, congratulated him on the boldness with
which he displayed his colours, and then shrank
back in astonished horror as he raised his claret-glass
to his lips. In one of the prettiest of
historical novels Amy Robsart is represented as
examining with childish wonder the various badges
and decorations which her husband wears, while
Leicester, amused by her simplicity, explains the
significance of each. "The embroidered strap, as
thou callest it, around my knee," he said, "is the
English Garter, an ornament which Kings are
proud to wear. See, here is the star which belongs
to it, and here is the diamond George, the
jewel of the Order. You have heard how King
Edward and the Countess of Salisbury&mdash;&mdash;" "Oh,
I know all that tale," said the Countess, slightly
blushing, "and how a lady's garter became the
proudest badge of English chivalry."</p>

<p>There are certain families which may be styled
"Garter Families," so constant&mdash;almost unbroken&mdash;has
been the tradition that the head of the
family should be a Knight Companion of the Most
Noble Order. Such is the House of Beaufort; is
there not a great saloon at Badminton walled
entirely with portraits of Dukes of Beaufort in
their flowing mantles of Garter-Blue? Such is
the House of Bedford, which has worn the Garter
from the reign of Henry VIII. till now; such the
House of Norfolk, which contrived to retain its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Garters, though it often lost its head, in times of
civil commotion. The Dukes of Devonshire, again,
have been habitual Garter-wearers; and the fourteenth
Earl of Derby, though he refused a dukedom,
was proud to accept an extra Garter (raising
the number of Knights above the statutory twenty-five),
which Queen Victoria gave him as a consolation
for his eviction from the Premiership in 1859.
<i>Punch</i>, then, as now, no respecter of persons,
had an excellent cartoon of a blubbering child, to
whom a gracious lady soothingly remarks, "Did
he have a nasty tumble, then? Here's something
pretty for him to play with." The Percys, again,
were pre-eminently a Garter Family; sixteen heads
of the house have worn Blue silk. So far as the
male line was concerned, they came to an end in
1670. The eventual heiress of the house married
Sir Hugh Smithson, who acquired the estates and
assumed the name of the historic Percys. Having,
in virtue of this great alliance, been created Earl
of Northumberland, Sir Hugh begged George III.
to give him the Garter. When the King demurred,
the aspirant exclaimed, in the bitterness of his
heart, "I am the first Northumberland who ever
was refused the Garter." To which the King replied,
not unreasonably, "And you are the first
Smithson who ever asked for it." However, there
are forms of political pressure to which even Kings
must yield, and people who had "borough influence"
could generally get their way when
George III. wanted some trustworthy votes in
the House of Commons. So Sir Hugh Smithson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
died a Duke and a K.G., and since his day the
Percys have been continuously Gartered.</p>

<p>But it is in the sphere of rank just below that
of the "Garter Families" that the Blue silk of
Swift's imagination exercises its most potent influence.
Men who are placed by the circumstances
of their birth far beyond the temptations of mere
cupidity, men who are justly satisfied with their
social position and have no special wish to be
transmogrified into marquises or dukes, are found
to desire the Garter with an almost passionate
fondness. Many a curious vote in a stand-or-fall
division, many an unexpected declaration at a
political crisis, many a transfer of local influence
at an important election has been dictated by
calculations about a possible Garter. It was this
view of the decoration which inspired Lord Melbourne
when, to the suggestion that he should take
a vacant Garter for himself, he replied, "But why
should I? I don't want to bribe myself." This
same light-hearted statesman disputes with Lord
Palmerston the credit of having said, "The great
beauty of the Garter is that there's no d&mdash;&mdash; d
nonsense of merit about it;" but it was undoubtedly
Palmerston who declined to pay the
customary fees to the Dean and Chapter of
Windsor, and on being gravely told that, unless
he paid, his banner could not be erected in St.
George's Chapel, replied that, as he never went to
church at Windsor or anywhere else, the omission
would not much affect him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>What made the recent Chapter of the Garter
peculiarly exciting to such as have æsthetic as well
as historic minds was the fact that, for once, the
Knights might be seen in the full splendour of
their magnificent costume. No other Order has
so elaborate a paraphernalia, and every detail
smacks deliciously of the antique world. The
long, sweeping mantle of Garter-blue is worn over
a surcoat and hood of crimson velvet. The hat is
trimmed with ostrich feathers and heron's plumes.
The enamelled collar swings majestically from
shoulder to shoulder; from it depends the image
of St. George trampling down the dragon; and
round the left knee runs the Garter itself, setting
forth the motto of the Order in letters of gold.
It is a truly regal costume; and those who saw
Lord Spencer so arrayed at the Coronation of
King Edward might have fancied that they were
gazing on an animated Vandyke. These full
splendours of the Order are seldom seen, but some
modifications of them appear on stated occasions.
The King was married in the mantle of the Garter,
worn over a Field-Marshal's uniform; and a
similar practice is observed at ceremonies in St.
George's Chapel. The Statutes of the Order bind
every Knight, on his chivalric obedience, to wear
the badge&mdash;the "George," as it is technically called&mdash;at
all times and places. In obedience to this rule
the Marquis of Abercorn, who died in 1818, always
went out shooting in the Blue Ribbon from which,
in ordinary dress, the badge depends. But those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
were the days when people played cricket in tall
hats and attended the House of Commons in knee-breeches
and silk stockings. Prince Albert, whose
conscience in ceremonial matters was even painfully
acute, always wore his Blue Ribbon over his
shirt and below his waistcoat; and in his ancient
photographs it can be dimly traced crossing his
chest in the neighbourhood of his shirt studs.
But to-day one chiefly sees it at dinners. A tradition
of the Order requires a Knight dining with a
brother-Knight to wear it, and after dinner one
may meet it at an evening party. The disuse of
knee-breeches, except in Royal company, makes it
practically impossible to display the actual Garter;
unless one chooses to follow the example of the
seventh Duke of Bedford, who, being of a skinny
habit and feeling the cold intensely, yet desiring
to display his Garter, used to wear it buckled
round the trouser of his left leg. Lord Beaconsfield,
in his later years, used to appear in the
evening with a most magnificent Star of the Garter
which had belonged to the wicked Lord Hertford,
Thackeray's Steyne and his own Monmouth. It
was a constellation of picked diamonds, surrounding
St. George's Cross in rubies. After Lord
Beaconsfield's death it was exposed for sale in a
jeweller's window, and eventually was broken up
and sold piecemeal. There was an opportunity
missed. Lord Rosebery ought to have bought it,
and kept it by him until he was entitled to wear it.</p>

<p>In picture-galleries one can trace the evolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of the Blue Ribbon through several shades and
shapes. In pictures of the Tudor and Stuart
periods it is a light blue ribbon, worn round the
neck, with the George hanging, like a locket, in
front. In Georgian pictures the ribbon is much
darker, and is worn over the left shoulder, reaching
down to the right thigh, where the George is
displayed. I have heard that the alteration of
position was due to the Duke of Monmouth, who,
when a little boy, accidentally thrust his right arm
through the ribbon, with a childish grace which
fascinated his father. The change of colour was
due to the fact that the exiled King at St. Germain's
affected still to bestow the Order, and the English
ribbon was made darker, so as to obviate all
possible confusion between the reality and the
counterfeit. Of late years, this reason having
ceased to operate, the King has returned to the
lighter shade.</p>

<p>The last Commoner who wore the Garter was
Sir Robert Walpole. Sir Robert Peel refused it.
It is the only honour which, I think, Mr. Gladstone
could have accepted without loss of dignity. For
he truly was a Knight <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>,
worthy to rank with those to whom, in the purer
days of chivalry, the Cross of St. George was not
the reward of an intrigue but the symbol of a faith.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXI</h2>

<p class="pch">SHERIFFS</p>

<p>The late Mr. Evelyn Philip Shirley, of Ettington,
the most enthusiastic and cultured of English
antiquaries, was once describing the procedure
observed on the rare occasion of a "Free Conference"
between the Houses of Parliament. "The
Lords," he said, "sit with their hats on their heads.
The Commons stand, uncovered, at the Bar; and
the carpet is spread not on the floor but on the
table, illustrating the phrase 'on the <i>tapis</i>.' Those
are the things which make life really worth
living."</p>

<p>I cannot profess to equal Mr. Shirley in culture,
but I yield to no man in enthusiasm for antiquarian
rites. Like Burke, I "piously believe in the mysterious
virtue of wax and parchment." With Mr.
Gladstone, I say that "the principle which gives us
ritual in Religion gives us the ceremonial of Courts,
the costume of judges, the uniform of regiments,
all the language of heraldry and symbol, all the
hierarchy of rank and title."</p>

<p>My antiquarian enthusiasm for the Garter must
not be allowed to brush aside the more obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
topic of the Sheriffs. That just now<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is a topic
which, as the French say, palpitates with actuality.
November is the Sheriffs' month; in it they bloom
like chrysanthemums&mdash;doomed, alas! to as brief a
splendour. The Sheriffs of London and Middlesex&mdash;those
glorious satellites who revolve round the
Lord Mayor of London as the Cardinals round the
Pope&mdash;are already installed. Their state carriages
of dazzling hue, and their liveries stiff with gold
bullion, have flung their radiance (as the late Mr. J.
R. Green would have said) over the fog and filth
of our autumnal climate.</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"Who asketh why the Beautiful was made?<br />
A wan cloud drifting o'er the waste of blue,</p>
<p class="pin4">The thistledown that floats along the glade,<br />
The lilac blooms of April&mdash;fair to view,<br />
And naught but fair are these; and such I ween are you.</p>
<p class="pin4">Yes, ye are beautiful. The young street boys<br />
Joy in your beauty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="pn1">But I am becoming rhapsodical, and with less
excuse than "C. S. C.," whose poetic fire was
kindled by the sight of the Beadles in the Burlington
Arcade.</p>

<p>On Monday the 12th of November, being the
morrow of St. Martin, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
in clothing of wrought gold and figured
silk, attending the ghost of what was once the
Court of Exchequer, nominates three gentlemen
of good estate to serve the office of High Sheriff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
for each of the counties of England. Be it remarked
in passing that the robe of black and
gold which the Chancellor wears on this occasion
is that which Mr. Gladstone's statue in the Strand
represents, and which, as a matter of fact, he
wore at the opening of the Law Courts in December
1882, when, to the astonishment of the
unlearned, he walked in procession among the
Judges.</p>

<p>Early in the new year&mdash;on "the morrow of the
Purification" to wit&mdash;the Lord President of the
Council submits the names of the nominated
Sheriffs, duly engrossed on parchment, to the
King, who then, with a silver bodkin, "pricks" the
name of the gentleman who in each county seems
the fittest of the three for the august and perilous
office of High Sheriff.</p>

<p>I love to handle great things greatly; so I have
refreshed my memory with the constitutional lore
of this high theme. The etymology of "Sheriff"
I find to be (on the indisputable authority of Dr.
Dryasdust) "Scirgeréfa&mdash;the 'Reeve' or Fiscal
Officer of a Shire." In the Saxon twilight of our
national history this Reeve, not yet developed into
Sheriff, ranked next in his county to the Bishop
and the Ealdorman, or Earl. In those days of
rudimentary self-government, the Reeve was elected
by popular vote, but Edward II., who seems to
have been a bureaucrat before his time, abolished
the form of election except as regards the cities,
and from his time onwards the High Sheriff of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
county has been a nominated officer. Until the
days of the Tudors, the High Sheriff wielded great
and miscellaneous powers. He was the military
head of the county. He commanded the "Posse
Comitatus," in which at his bidding every male
over fifteen was forced to serve; and he was, in
all matters of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the
executant and minister of the law.</p>

<p><i>Quomodo ceciderunt fortes!</i> Henry VIII. at one
fell swoop terminated the Sheriff's military power
and made the new-fangled Lord-Lieutenant commander
of the local forces; and successive Acts
of Parliament have, by increasing the powers of
courts and magistracies, reduced the civil power of
the Sheriff to a dismal shadow of its former greatness.
Still, in the person of his unromantic representative,
the "Bound Bailiff," he watches the
execution of civil process in the case of those who,
to use a picturesque phrase, have "outrun the
constable"; still, with all the pantomimic pomp
of coach and footmen, trumpeters and javelin-men,
he conducts the Judges of Assize to and from the
court; and still he must be present in court when
the capital sentence is pronounced. I believe I am
right in stating that there is no such document as a
"Death-warrant" known to English jurisprudence.
The only warrant for the execution of a felon is
the verbal sentence of the Judge pronounced in
open court; and, as the High Sheriff is responsible
for the due execution of that sentence, he
must be present when it is pronounced, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that he may know, by the evidence of his own
eyes, that the person brought out for execution is
the person on whom the sentence was pronounced.
It is probable that many of my readers recollect
the first Lord Tollemache, a man who combined
singular gifts of physical strength with a delicate
humanitarianism. He had been High Sheriff of
Cheshire in very early life, and, till he was elevated
to the Peerage, it was possible that his turn might
come round again. Contemplating this contingency,
he said that if he were again charged with
the execution of a capital sentence, he should,
on his own authority, offer the condemned man
a dose of chloroform, so that, if he chose, he
might go unconscious to his doom.</p>

<p>The duties connected with the capital sentence
are, of course, infinitely the most trying of those
which befall a High Sheriff; but even in other
respects his lot is not an unmixed pleasure. If
he is a poor man, the expense of conducting the
Assizes with proper dignity is considerable. A
sensitive man does not like to hear invidious
comparisons between his carriages, horses, and
liveries, and those of his predecessor in office.
He winces under the imputation of an unworthy
economy; and, if his equipage was conspicuously
unequal to the occasion, the Judges have been
known to express their displeasure by sarcasms,
protests, and even fines. The fining power of a
Judge on circuit is a mysterious prerogative. I
have no notion whether it is restrained by statutory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
limitations, by what process the fine is enforced,
or into whose pocket it finds its way.
Some years ago the High Sheriff of Surrey published
a placard at the Guildford Assizes setting
forth that the public were excluded from the
court by the Judge's order and in defiance of
law, and warning his subordinate officers against
giving effect to the order for exclusion. The
Judge pronounced the placard "a painfully contumacious
contempt of the Court," and fined the
High Sheriff £500. My memory does not recall,
and the records do not state, whether the
mulcted officer paid up or climbed down.</p>

<p>If the High Sheriff has a friend or kinsman
in Holy Orders, the Assizes afford an excellent
opportunity of bringing him to public notice in
the capacity of Sheriff's Chaplain; for the Chaplain
preaches before the Judges at the opening
of the Assize, and, if he is ambitious of fame,
he can generally contrive to make something
of the occasion. But few Chaplains, I should
think, have emulated the courage of Sydney Smith,
who at the York Assizes in 1824 rebuked the
besetting sins of Bench and Bar in two remarkably
vigorous sermons on these suggestive themes&mdash;"The
Judge that smites contrary to the Law"
and "The Lawyer that tempted Christ."</p>

<p>Broadly, I suppose it may be said that the
people who really enjoy being High Sheriffs are
not those who, by virtue of long hereditary connexion
with the soil, are to the manner born;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
but rather those who by commercial industry
have accumulated capital, and have invested it
in land with a view to founding a family. To
such, the hospitalities paid and the deference
received, the quaint splendour of the Assize, and
the undisputed precedence over the gentlemen
of the County, are joys not lightly to be esteemed.
When Lothair was arranging the splendid ceremonial
for his famous Coming of Age, he said
to the Duchess, "There is no doubt that, in the
County, the High Sheriff takes precedence of
every one, even of the Lord-Lieutenant; but how
about his wife? I believe there is some tremendous
question about the lady's precedence. We
ought to have written to the Heralds' College."
The Duchess graciously gave Mrs. High Sheriff
the benefit of the doubt, and the ceremonies
went forward without a hitch. On the night of
the great banquet Lothair looked round, and
then, "in an audible voice, and with a stateliness
becoming such an incident, called upon the High
Sheriff to lead the Duchess to the table. Although
that eminent man had been thinking of nothing
else for days, and during the last half-hour had
felt as a man feels, and can only feel, who knows
that some public function is momentarily about
to fall to his perilous discharge, he was taken
quite aback, changed colour, and lost his head.
But Lothair's band, who were waiting at the door
of the apartment to precede the procession to
the hall, striking up at this moment "The Roast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Beef of Old England," reanimated his heart, and,
following Lothair and preceding all the other
guests down the gallery and through many chambers,
he experienced the proudest moment in a
life of struggle, ingenuity, vicissitude, and success."</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXII</h2>

<p class="pch">PUBLISHERS</p>

<p>There is a passage in Selden's "Table-Talk"
which, if I recollect it aright, may be paraphrased
in some such form as this: The Lion, reeking of
slaughter, met his neighbour the Sheep, and, after
exchanging the time of day with her, asked her if
his breath smelt of blood. She replied "Yes,"
whereupon he snapped off her head for a fool.
Immediately afterwards he met the Jackal, to
whom he addressed the same question. The
Jackal answered "No," and the Lion tore him in
pieces for a flatterer. Last of all he met the Fox,
and asked the question a third time. The Fox
replied that he had a cold in his head, and could
smell nothing. <i>Moral</i>: "Wise men say little in
dangerous times." The bearing of this aphorism
on my present subject is sufficiently obvious; the
"times"&mdash;not <i>Times</i>&mdash;are "dangerous" alike
for authors and publishers, and "wise men" will
"say little" about current controversies, lest they
should have their heads snapped off by Mr. Lucas
and Mr. Graves, or be torn in pieces by Mr.
Moberley Bell.</p>

<p>Thus warned, I turn my thoughts to Publishers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
as they have existed in the past, and more particularly
to their relations with the authors whose
works they have given to the world. How happy
those relations may be, when maintained with tact
and temper on both sides, is well illustrated by
an anecdote of that indefatigable penwoman, "the
gorgeous Lady Blessington." Thinking herself
injured by some delay on the part of her publishers,
Messrs. Sanders &amp; Otley, she sent her
son-in-law, the irrepressible Count D'Orsay, to
remonstrate. The Count was received by a dignified
gentleman in a stiff white cravat, whom he
proceeded to assail with the most vigorous invective,
until the cravated gentleman could stand it
no longer and roundly declared that he would
sacrifice Lady Blessington's patronage sooner than
subject himself to personal insult. "Personal?"
exclaimed the lively Count. "There's nothing personal
in my remarks. If you're Sanders, then
d&mdash;&mdash; Otley; if you're Otley, then d&mdash;&mdash; Sanders."</p>

<p>It is to be feared that a similar imprecation has
often formed itself in the heart, though it may not
have issued from the lips, of a baulked and disillusioned
author. Though notoriously the most
long-suffering of a patient race, the present writer
has before now felt inclined to borrow the vigorous
invective of Count D'Orsay. Some six months
before American copyright was, after long negotiation,
secured for English authors, Messrs. Popgood
and Groolly (I borrow the names from Sir Frank
Burnand) arranged with me for the publication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a modest work. It was quite ready for publication,
but the experienced publishers pointed out the desirability
of keeping it back till the new law of copyright
came into force, for there was a rich harvest
to be reaped in America; and all the American
profits, after, say, five thousand copies were sold,
were to be mine alone. A year later I received
a cheque, 18s. 6d., which, I imagine, bore the same
relation to the American profits as Mrs. Crupp's
"one cold kidney on a cheese-plate" bore to the
remains of David Copperfield's feast. On enquiry
I was soothingly informed by Popgood and Groolly
that the exact number of copies sold in America
was 5005, and that the cheque represented (as per
agreement) the royalty on the copies sold, over and
above the first five thousand. That the publishers
should have so accurately estimated the American
sale seemed to me a remarkable instance of commercial
foresight.</p>

<p>Not much more amiable are the feelings of the
author towards the publisher who declines his
wares; and I have always felt that Washington
Irving must have had a keen and legitimate satisfaction
in prefixing to his immensely popular
"Sketch-Book" the flummery in which old John
Murray wrapped up his refusal of the manuscript:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I entreat you to believe that I feel truly obliged
by your kind intentions towards me, and that I
entertain the most unfeigned respect for your most
tasteful talents. If it would not suit me to engage
in the publication of your present work, it is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
because I do not see that scope in the nature of it
which would enable me to make those satisfactory
accounts between us which I really feel no satisfaction
in engaging."</p>

<p>Now, surely, as Justice Shallow says, good phrases
are, and ever were, very commendable. While
Murray dealt in good phrases, his rival Longman
expressed himself through the more tangible
medium of good cheques. He was the London
publisher, and apparently the financier, of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and, according to Sydney
Smith's testimony, his fiscal system was simplicity
itself. "I used to send in a bill in these words,
'Messrs. Longman &amp; Co. to the Rev. Sydney
Smith. To a very wise and witty article on such
a subject; so many sheets, at forty-five guineas
a sheet,' and the money always came." Here is
another passage from the financial dealings of the
same great house, which during the last fifty years
has caused many a penman's mouth to water.
On the 7th of March 1856 Macaulay wrote in
his diary: "Longman came, with a very pleasant
announcement. He and his partners find that
they are overflowing with money, and think that
they cannot invest it better than by advancing
to me, on the usual terms of course, part of what
will be due to me in December. We agreed that
they shall pay twenty thousand pounds into
Williams's Bank next week. What a sum to
be gained by one edition of a book! I may
say, gained in one day. But that was harvest-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
The work had been near seven years in
hand."</p>

<p>After that glorious instance, all tales of profit
from books seem flat and insignificant. As a rule,
we have to reckon our makings on a far more
modest scale. "Sir," said an enthusiastic lady
to Mr. Zangwill, "I admire 'The Children of the
Ghetto' so much that I have read it eight times."
"Madam," replied Mr. Zangwill, "I would rather
you had bought eight copies." Even so, with our
exiguous profit on eight copies duly sold, our state
is more gracious than that of more deserving men.
Here is a touching vignette from a book of travels,
which was popular in my youth: "At <i>table d'hôte</i>
there is a charming old gentleman who has translated
Æschylus and Euripides into English verse;
he has been complimented by the greatest scholars
of the day, and his publishers have just sent him in
his bill for printing, and a letter to know what
the deuce they shall do with the first thousand."</p>

<p>Such are the joys of publishing at one's own
risk. Hardly more exhilarating is the experience
of knocking at all the doors in Paternoster Row,
or Albemarle Street, or Waterloo Place, and imploring
the stony-hearted publisher to purchase
one's modest wares. Old John Murray's soothing
formula about "most tasteful talents" has been reproduced,
with suitable variations, from that time
to this. No one experienced it oftener than the
late Mr. Shorthouse, whose one good book&mdash;"John
Inglesant"&mdash;made the rounds of the Trade, until at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
length Messrs. Macmillan recognized its strange
power. In their hands, as every one knows, the
book prospered exceedingly, and the publishers
who had rejected it were consumed by remorse.
In this connexion my friend Mr. James Payn used
to tell a story which outweighs a great many acrid
witticisms about "Barabbas was a Publisher" and
Napoleon's one meritorious action in hanging a
Bookseller. Payn was "reader" to Smith and
Elder, and in that capacity declined the manuscript
of "John Inglesant." Some years afterwards
this fact was stated in print, together with an estimate
of what his error had cost his firm. Payn,
who was the last man to sit down patiently under a
calumny, told the late Mr. George Smith that he
felt bound in self-respect to contradict a story so
derogatory to his literary judgment. "If I were
you," replied Mr. Smith, "I wouldn't do that, for,
as a matter of fact, you did reject the manuscript,
and we have lost what Macmillans have gained. I
never told you, because I knew it would annoy
you; and I only tell you now to prevent you from
contradicting 'an ower true tale.'" Payn used to
say that, in all the annals of business, considerate
forbearance had never been better exemplified.
Against this story of his failure to perceive merit
Payn was wont to set his discovery of Mr. Anstey
Guthrie. The manuscript of "Vice Versa," bearing
the unknown name of "F. Anstey," came in ordinary
course into his hands. He glanced at the
first page, turned over, read to the end, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
ran into Mr. Smith's room saying, "We've got the
funniest thing that has been written since Dickens's
'Christmas Carol.'" And the public gave unequivocal
evidence that it concurred in the verdict.</p>

<p>Let a "smooth tale of love" close these reminiscences
of Publishers. Some forty years ago, when
all young and ardent spirits had caught the sacred
fire of Italian freedom from Garibaldi and Swinburne
and Mrs. Browning, a young lady, nurtured
in the straitest of Tory homes, was inspired&mdash;it is
hardly too strong a word&mdash;to write a book of ballads
in which the heroes and the deeds of the Italian
Revolution were glorified. She knew full well that,
if she were detected, her father would have a stroke
and her mother would lock her up in the spare
bedroom. So, in sending her manuscript to a
publisher, she passed herself off as a man. Her
vigorous and vehement style, her strong grasp
of the political situation, and her enjoyment of
battle and bloodshed, contributed to the illusion;
her poems were published anonymously; other
volumes followed; and for several years the publisher
addressed his contributor as "Esquire." At
length it chanced that both publisher and poetess
were staying, unknown to each other, at the same
seaside place. Her letter, written from&mdash;let us say&mdash;Brighton,
reached him at Brighton; so, instead
of answering by post, he went to the hotel and
asked for Mr. Talbot, or whatever great Tory name
you prefer. The porter said, "There is no Mr.
Talbot staying here. There is a Miss Talbot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
she may be able to give you some information."
So Miss Talbot was produced; the secret of the
authorship was disclosed; and the negotiations
took an entirely new turn, which ended in making
the poetess the publisher's wife.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">HANDWRITING</p>

<p>When "The Book of Snobs" was appearing week
by week in <i>Punch</i>, Thackeray derived constant
aid from suggestive correspondents. "'Why only
attack the aristocratic Snobs?' says one estimable
gentleman. 'Are not the snobbish Snobs to have
their turn?' 'Pitch into the University Snobs!'
writes an indignant correspondent (who spells
<i>elegant</i> with two <i>l</i>'s)."</p>

<p>Similarly, if I may compare small things with
great, I am happy in the possession of an unknown
friend who, from time to time, supplies me with
references to current topics which he thinks suitable
to my gentle methods of criticism. My friend
(unlike Thackeray's correspondent) can spell <i>elegant</i>,
and much longer words too, with faultless accuracy,
and is altogether, as I judge, a person of much
culture. It is this circumstance, I suppose (for he
has no earthly connexion with the Army), which
makes him feel so keenly about a cutting from a
newspaper which he has just sent us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In a report just issued by the War Office on
the result of examinations for promotion many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
officers are said to be handicapped by their bad
handwriting. Some show of 'want of intelligence,
small power of expression, poor penmanship&mdash;in
fact, appear to suffer from defective education.'</p>

<p>"On the other hand, the work of non-commissioned
officers shows intelligence and power of
concise expression, while penmanship is good.</p>

<p>"But the percentage of failures among the officers
shows a large decrease&mdash;from 22 per cent. in
November 1904 to 13 per cent. in May last. The
improvement is particularly noticeable among lieutenants.
It is apparent, says the report, that a
serious effort is being made by the commissioned
ranks to master all the text-books and other aids to
efficiency."</p>

<p>"This," says my correspondent, "is a shameful
disclosure. Cannot you say something about
it in print?" Inclining naturally to the more
favourable view of my fellow-creatures, I prefer
to reflect, not on the "poor penmanship"
and "defective education" of my military friends,
but on their manly efforts after self-improvement.
There is something at once pathetic and edifying
in the picture of these worthy men, each of whom
has probably cost his father £200 a year for
education ever since he was ten years old, making
their "serious effort to master the text-books
and other aids to efficiency," in the humble hope
that their writing may some day rival that of
the non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>It was not ever thus. These laudable, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
lowly, endeavours after Culture are of recent
growth in the British Army. Fifty years ago, if
we may trust contemporary evidence, the Uneducated
Subaltern developed, by a natural process,
into the Uneducated General.</p>

<p>"I have always," said Thackeray in 1846, "admired
that dispensation of rank in our country
which sets up a budding Cornet, who is shaving
for a beard (and who was flogged only last week
because he could not spell), to command great
whiskered warriors who have faced all dangers
of climate and battle." <i>Because he could not
spell.</i> The same infirmity accompanied the
Cornet into the higher grades of his profession&mdash;witness
Captain Rawdon Crawley's memorandum
of his available effects: "My double-barril by
Manton, say 40 guineas; my duelling pistols in
rosewood case (same which I shot Captain Marker)
£20." And, even when the Cornet had blossomed
into a General, his education was still far from
complete: "A man can't help being a fool, be
he ever so old, and Sir George Tufto is a greater
ass at sixty-eight than he was when he entered
the army at fifteen. He never read a book in
his life, and, with his purple, old, gouty fingers,
still writes a schoolboy hand."</p>

<p>But do Soldiers write a worse hand than other
people? I rather doubt it, and certain I am that
several of my friends, highly placed in Church
and politics and law, would do very well to apply
themselves for a season to those "text-books and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
other aids to efficiency" by which the zealous
Subaltern seeks to complete his "defective education."</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone was accustomed to say that in
public life he had known only two perfect things&mdash;Sir
Robert Peel's voice and Lord Palmerston's
writing. The former we can know only by tradition;
the latter survives, for the instruction of
mankind, in folios of voluminous despatches, all
written in a hand at once graceful in form and
absolutely clear to read. "The wayfaring men"
of Diplomacy, though sometimes "fools," could
not "err" in the interpretation of Palmerston's
despatches. The same excellence of caligraphy
which Palmerston himself practised he rightly
required from his subordinates. If a badly written
despatch came into his hands, he would embellish
it with scathing rebukes, and return it, through the
Office, to the offending writer. The recipient of
one of these admonitions thus recalls its terms,
"Tell the gentleman who copied this despatch
to write a larger, rounder hand, to join the letters
in the words, and to use blacker ink."</p>

<p>If Lord Palmerston stood easily first among
the penmen of his time, the credit of writing the
worst hand in England was divided among at
least three claimants. First there was Lord
Houghton, whose strange, tall, upright strokes,
all exactly like each other except in so far as
they leaned in different directions, Lord Tennyson
likened to "walking-sticks gone mad." Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
there was my dear friend Mr. James Payn, who
described his own hand only too faithfully when
he wrote about "the wandering of a centipede
which had just escaped from the inkpot and had
scrawled and sprawled over the paper," and whose
closest friends always implored him to correspond
by telegraph. And, finally, there was the "bad
eminence" of Dean Stanley, whose lifelong indulgence
in hieroglyphics inflicted a permanent loss
on literature. The Dean, as all readers of his
biography will remember, had a marked turn for
light and graceful versification. The albums and
letter-caskets of his innumerable friends were full
of these "occasional" verses, in which domestic,
political, and ecclesiastical events were prettily
perpetuated. After his death his sister, Mrs.
Vaughan, tried to collect these fugitive pieces in
a Memorial Volume, but an unforeseen difficulty
occurred. In many cases the recipients of the
poems were dead and gone, and no living creature
could decipher the Dean's writing. So what might
have been a pretty and instructive volume perished
untimely.</p>

<p>Jane Maxwell, Duchess of Gordon, the brilliant
dame who raised the Gordon Highlanders and
who played on the Tory side the part which the
Duchess of Devonshire played among the Whigs,
had, like our English Subalterns, a very imperfect
education; but with great adroitness she covered
her deficiences with a cloak of seeming humour.
"Whenever," she wrote to Sir Walter Scott, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
come to a word which I cannot spell, I write it
as near as I can, and put a note of exclamation
after it; so that, if it's wrong, my friend will think
that I was making a joke." A respected member
of the present Cabinet who shares Duchess Jane's
orthographical weakness covers his retreat by
drawing a long, involuted line after the initial
letter of each word. Let the reader write, say,
the word "aluminium" on this principle; and
he will see how very easily imperfect spelling in
high places may be concealed.</p>

<p>With soldiers this chapter began, and with a
soldier it shall end&mdash;the most illustrious of them
all, Arthur, Duke of Wellington. Let it be recorded
for the encouragement of our modern
Subalterns that the Duke, though he spelled much
better than Captain Crawley, wrote quite as badly
as Sir George Tufto; but that circumstance did
not&mdash;as is sometimes the case&mdash;enable him to interpret
by sympathy the hieroglyphics of other
people. Is there any one left, "In a Lancashire
Garden" or elsewhere, who recalls the honoured
name of Jane Loudon, authoress of "The Lady's
Companion to her Flower Garden"? Mrs. Loudon
was an accomplished lady, who wrote not only on
Floriculture, but on Arboriculture and Landscape
Gardening, and illustrated what she wrote. In
one of her works she desired to insert a sketch
of the "Waterloo Beeches" at Strathfieldsaye&mdash;a
picturesque clump planted to commemorate our
deliverance from the Corsican Tyrant. Accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
she wrote to the Duke of Wellington, requesting
leave to sketch the beeches, and signed
herself, in her usual form, "J. Loudon." The
Duke, who, in spite of extreme age and perceptions
not quite so clear as they had once been,
insisted on conducting all his own correspondence,
replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"F.M. the Duke of Wellington presents his
compliments to the Bishop of London. The
Bishop is quite at liberty to make a sketch of
the breeches which the Duke wore at Waterloo,
if they can be found. But the Duke is not
aware that they differed in any way from the
breeches which he generally wears."</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">AUTOGRAPHS</p>

<p>From handwriting in general to autographs in particular
the transition is natural, almost inevitable.
My recent reflections on the imperfect penmanship
of the British officer sent me to my collection of
letters, and the sight of these autographs&mdash;old
friends long since hidden away&mdash;set me on an
interesting enquiry. Was there any affinity between
the writing and the character? Could one,
in any case, have guessed who the writer was, or
what he did, merely by scrutinizing his manuscript?
I make no pretension to any skill in the
art or science of Caligraphy; and, regarding my
letters merely as an amateur or non-expert, I
must confess that I arrive at a mixed and dubious
result. Some of the autographs are characteristic
enough; some seem to imply qualities for which
the writer was not famed and to suppress others
for which he was notorious.</p>

<p>Let us look carefully at the first letter which I
produce from my hoard. The lines are level, and
the words are clearly divided, although here and
there an abbreviation tells that the hand which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
wrote this letter had many letters to write; the
capitals, of which there are plenty, are long and
twirling, though the intermediate letters are rather
small, and the signature is followed by an emphatic
dash which seems to say more explicitly than
words that the writer is one who cannot be ignored.
This is the autograph of Queen Victoria in those
distant days when she said, "They seem to think
that I am a schoolgirl, but I will teach them that I
am Queen of England."</p>

<p>Surrounding and succeeding Queen Victoria I
find a cluster of minor royalties, but a study of
their autographs does not enable me to generalize
about royal writing. Some are scrawling and
some are cramped; some are infantine and some
foreign. Here is a level, firm, and rapid hand,
in which the exigencies of a copious correspondence
seem to have softened the stiffness of a military
gait. The letter is dated from "The Horse
Guards," and the signature is</p>

<p class="pi8 p1">"Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr8"><span class="smcap">George</span>."</p>

<p class="pn1">But here again we cannot generalize, for nothing
can be more dissimilar than the Duke's hurried,
high-shouldered characters and the exquisite piece
of penmanship which lies alongside of them. This
is written in a leisurely and cultivated hand,
with due spaces between words and paragraphs,
like the writing of a scholar and man of letters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
it is dated May 29, 1888, and bears the signature
of</p>

<p class="pi8 p1">"Your affectionate Cousin,</p>
<p class="pr8"><span class="smcap">Albemarle</span>,"</p>

<p class="pn1">the last survivor but one of Waterloo.</p>

<p>But soldiers are not much in my way, and my
military signatures are few. My collection is rich
in politicians. Here comes, first in date though
in nothing else, that Duke of Bedford who negotiated
the Treaty of Fontainebleau and got trounced
by Junius for his pains. It is written in 1767, just
as the writer is "setting out from Woburn Abbey
to consult his Shropshire oculist" (why Shropshire?),
and has the small, cramped character
which is common to so many conditions of
shortened sight. (I find exactly the same in a
letter of Lord Chancellor Hatherley, 1881.) Thirty-nine
years pass, and William Pitt writes his last
letter from "Putney Hill, the 1st of January, 1806,
2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>," the writing as clear, as steady, and as
beautifully formed as if the "Sun of Austerlitz"
had never dawned. And now the Statesmen
pass me in rapid succession and in fine disregard
of chronological order. Lord Russell writes a
graceful, fluent, rather feminine hand; Charles
Villiers's writing is of the same family; and the
great Lord Derby's a perfect specimen of the
"Italian hand," delicate as if drawn with a crow-quill,
and slanted into alluring tails and loops.
Lord Brougham's was a vile scrawl, with half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
letters tumbling backwards. John Bright's is small,
neat, and absolutely clear; nor is it fanciful to
surmise that Mr. Chamberlain copied Mr. Bright,
and were they not both short-sighted men? And
Lord Goschen's writing, from the same cause, is
smaller still. The Duke of Argyll wrote a startling
and imperious hand, worthy of a Highland chief
whose ancestors not so long ago exercised the
power of life and death; Lord Iddesleigh a neat
and orderly hand, becoming a Private Secretary
or Permanent Official. Lord Granville's and Mr.
Forster's writings had this in common, that they
looked most surprisingly candid and straightforward.
The present Duke of Devonshire's writing
suggests nothing but vanity, self-consciousness,
and ostentation. We all can judge, even without
being caligraphists, how far these suggestions
conform to the facts. By far the most pleasing
autograph of all the Statesmen is Lord Beaconsfield's,
artistically formed and highly finished&mdash;in
his own phrase, "that form of scripture which
attracts." With the utmost possible loyalty to a
lost leader, I would submit that Mr. Gladstone
wrote an uncommonly bad hand&mdash;not bad in
point of appearance, for it was neat and comely
even when it was hurried; but bad morally&mdash;a
kind of caligraphic imposture, for it looks quite
remarkably legible, and it is only when you
come to close quarters with it and try to decipher
an important passage that you find that
all the letters are practically the same, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the interpretation of a word must depend on the
context.</p>

<p>From my pile of Statesmen's autographs I extract
yet another, and I lay it side by side with the
autographs of a great author and a great ecclesiastic.
All three are very small, exquisitely neat,
very little slanted, absolutely legible. Well as I
knew the three writers, I doubt if I could tell which
wrote which letter. They were Cardinal Manning,
Mr. Froude, and Lord Rosebery. Will the experts
in caligraphy tell me if, in this case, similarity of
writing bodied forth similarity of gifts or qualities?
Another very close similarity may be observed
between the writing of Lord Halsbury and that
of Lord Brampton (better known as Sir Henry
Hawkins), which, but for the fact that Lord
Brampton uses the long "s" and Lord Halsbury
does not, are pretty nearly identical.</p>

<p>If there is one truth which can be deduced more
confidently than another from my collection of
autographs, it is that there is no such thing as "the
literary hand." Every variety of writing which a
"Reader's" fevered brain could conceive is illustrated
in my bundle of literary autographs. <i>Seniores
priores.</i> Samuel Rogers was born in 1763, and
died in 1855. A note of his, written in 1849, and
beginning, "Pray, pray, come on Tuesday," is by
far the most surprising piece of caligraphy in my
collection. It is so small that, except under the
eyes of early youth, it requires a magnifying-glass;
yet the symmetry of every letter is perfect, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
when sufficiently enlarged, it might stand as a
model of beautiful and readable writing. I take
a bound of sixty years, and find some of the
same characteristics reproduced by my friend
Mr. Quiller-Couch; but between the "Pleasures
of Memory" and "Green Bays" there rolls a sea
of literature, and it has been navigated by some
strange crafts in the way of handwriting. I have
spoken on another occasion of Dean Stanley, Lord
Houghton, and James Payn; specimens of their
enormities surround me as I write, and I can
adduce, I think, an equally heinous instance.
Here is Sydney Smith, writing in 1837 to "Dear
John," the hero of the Reform Act, "No body
wishes better for you and yours than the inhabitants
of Combe Florey." Perhaps so; but they
conveyed their benedictions through a very irritating
medium, for Sydney Smith's writing is of the
immoral type, pleasing to the eye and superficially
legible, but, when once you have lost the clue, a
labyrinth. Perhaps it is due to this circumstance
that his books abound, beyond all others, in uncorrected
misprints.</p>

<p>But there are other faults in writing besides
ugliness and illegibility. A great man ought not
to write a poor hand. Yet nothing can be poorer
than Ruskin's&mdash;mean, ugly, insignificant&mdash;only
redeemed by perfect legibility. Goldwin Smith's,
though clear and shapely, is characterless and
disappointing. Some great scholars, again, write
disappointing hands. Jowett's is a spiteful-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
angular, little scratch, perfectly easy to read; Westcott's
comely but not clear; Lightfoot's an open,
scrambling scrawl, something like the late Lord
Derby's. These great men cannot excuse their
deficiencies in penmanship by pleading that they
have had to write a great deal in their lives.
Others before them have had to do that, and have
emerged from the trial without a stain on their
caligraphy. For example&mdash;"Albany, December
3, 1854," is the heading of an ideally beautiful
sheet, every letter perfectly formed, all spaces duly
observed, and the whole evidently maintaining its
beauty in spite of breakneck speed. The signature
is</p>

<p class="pi8 p1">"Ever yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr8"><span class="smcap">T. B. Macaulay</span>."</p>

<p class="p1">Here is a letter addressed to me only last year
by a man who was born in 1816. In my whole
collection there is no clearer or prettier writing.
As a devotee of fine penmanship, I make my
salutations to Sir Theodore Martin.</p>

<p class="pch">MORE AUTOGRAPHS</p>

<p>My suggestive friend has suddenly been multiplied
a hundredfold. Handwriting is a subject which
apparently makes a wide appeal. Each post brings
me corrections or corroborations of what I wrote
last Saturday. Fresh instances of enormity in the
way of illegible writing are adduced from all
quarters; nor are there wanting acrid critics who
suggest that reform should begin at home, and
that "the Author of Collections and Recollections"
would do well to consult a writing-master,
or to have his copy typed before it goes to the
printers. Waiving these personalities, I turn again
to my letter-case, and here let me say in passing
that I committed a fearful indiscretion when I
spoke of my "Collection" of autographs. That fatal
word brought down an avalanche of "Collectors,"
who, hailing me as a man and a brother, propose
all sorts of convenient exchanges. A gentleman
who cherishes a postcard from Mr. Rudyard
Kipling would exchange it for an unpublished
letter of Shelley; and a maiden-lady at Weston-super-Mare,
whose great-aunt corresponded with
Eliza Cook, will refuse no reasonable offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>But all these handsome propositions must be
brushed aside, for I have no collection of autographs,
if "collection" implies any art or system in the
way in which they have been brought together,
or any store of saleable duplicates. Mine are
simply letters addressed to myself or to my kinsfolk,
plus just a very few which have come into
my hands in connexion with public business; but,
such as they are, they are full of memories and
morals.</p>

<p>Why did very old people write so well? I have
already described the writing of Samuel Rogers,
of the Waterloo Lord Albemarle, and of Sir
Theodore Martin. Pretty well for octogenarian
penmanship; but I can enlarge the gallery. A
bundle of octogenarian letters lies before me as
I write. Oliver Wendell Holmes sends a tribute
to Matthew Arnold. Charles Villiers accepts an
invitation to dinner. Lord Norton invites me to
stay at Hams. Archdeacon Denison complains
of "his first attack of gout at eighty-five." Mr.
Leveson-Gower at eighty-six thanks me for a
review of his first book. I protest that there is
not an ungraceful line&mdash;scarcely a misshaped
letter&mdash;in any of these five manuscripts. Here is
a small, elegant, and "taily" hand, rather like an
old-fashioned lady's. The signature is</p>

<p class="pi8 p1">"Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr8"><span class="smcap">Eversley</span>,"</p>

<p class="pn1">better known as Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, the most authoritative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Speaker the House of Commons ever had.
Note that this was written in his eighty-eighth
year, and he lived to buy a new pair of guns after
he was ninety. Here is a strong, clear, well-defined
writing, setting forth with precision and emphasis
the reasons why the last Duke of Cleveland, then
in his eighty-fifth year, will not give more than £5
for an object which he has been asked to help.
The writing of the beloved and honoured Duke
of Rutland, always graceful and regular, becomes
markedly smaller, though not the least less legible,
till he dies at eighty-seven. There is no more
vigorous, even dashing, signature in my store than
"G. J. Holyoake," written in July 1905. Close to
the imperial purple of the Agitator's ink nestles,
in piquant contrast, a small half-sheet of rose-pink
paper bearing a Duchess's coronet and cypher.
The writing is distinct and ornamental; the letter
was written in 1880, and the writer was born
in 1792. But the mere fact of attaining to eighty
or ninety years will not absolutely guarantee,
though it seems to promote, legibility of writing.
My venerable friend Dean Randall, who was born
in 1824, ends a letter, which certainly needs some
such apology, with a disarming allusion to the
"dreadful scrawl" of his "ancient MS."; and
four sides of tantalizing hieroglyphics, drawn apparently
with a blunt stick, are shown by external
evidence to be a letter from Canon Carter of
Clewer when he had touched his ninetieth birthday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>On similarity, approaching to identity, between
the writings of very dissimilar persons I have
already remarked, and a further illustration comes
to light as I turn over my papers. Here are two
letters in the graceful and legible script of the early
nineteenth century, with long S's, and capitals for
all the substantives. Both are evidently the handiwork
of cultivated gentlemen; and both the writers,
as a matter of fact, were clergymen. But there the
resemblance stops. The one was "Jack" Russell,
the well-known Sporting Parson of Exmoor; the
other was Andrew Jukes, the deepest and most
influential Mystic whom the latter-day Church has
seen.</p>

<p>When I praise gracefulness in writing I mean
natural and effortless grace, such as was displayed
in the writing of the late Duke of Westminster.
But, if we admire writing artificially fashioned and
coerced into gracefulness like a clipped yew, it
would be difficult to excel the penmanship of the
late George Augustus Sala, who was an engraver
before he was an author; or that of Sir A. Conan
Doyle, who handles a pen as dexterously as in his
surgical days he wielded the lancet. I praised just
now the late Duke of Westminster's writing, and
of him one might say what Scott said, in a different
sense, of Byron&mdash;that he "managed his pen
with the careless and negligent ease of a man of
quality"; but there is another kind of grace than
that&mdash;the grace which is partly the result of mental
clearness and partly of a cultured eye. Here are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
two specimens of such writing, the letters so alluringly
fashioned that they look, as some one said,
like something good to eat; and spaced with a care
which at once makes reading easy, and testifies to
clear thinking in the writer. Both are the writings
of Scholars, and both of men who wrote a vast
deal in their lives&mdash;Bishop Creighton and Dean
Vaughan. It must have been a joy to read their
Proofs. The late Dean Farrar was the only Public-School
Master I ever knew who took pains with
his pupils' writing and encouraged them to add
grace to legibility. His own writing, small, upright,
and characterful, was very pretty when he
took time and pains; but the specimen which lies
before me shows sad signs of the havoc wrought
by incessant writing against time.</p>

<p>Grace and legibility are the two chief glories of
penmanship, but other attributes are not without
their effect. A dashing scrawl, if only it is easy
to read, suggests a soaring superiority to conventional
restraints, and rather bespeaks a hero. Here
are two scrawls, and each is the work of a remarkable
person. One is signed "Yours truly,
Jos. Cowen," and I dare say that some of my
readers would see in it the index to a nature at
once impetuous and imperious. But Mr. Cowen's
scrawl was crowquill-work and copperplate compared
with its next-door neighbour. "Accept the
enclosed, dear Mr. Russell," covers the whole of
one side of a sheet of letter-paper; the ink is
blue; the paper is ribbed; the signature, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
wreathed in gigantic flourishes and curling tails,
is "Laura Thistlethwaite," and the enclosed is
one of the Evangelistic Addresses of that gifted
preacher who once was Laura Bell. Odd incongruities
keep turning up. As I pass from the
Evangelical lady-orator, I come to Father Ignatius,
an Evangelical orator with a difference, but with
a like tendency to scrawl. Lord Leighton's writing
is also a scrawl, and, it must be confessed, an
egotistical scrawl, and a very bad scrawl to read.
An illegible scrawl, too, is the writing of Richard
Holt Hutton, but his is not a vainglorious or commanding
scrawl, but rather humble and untidy.
"Henry Irving" is a signature quite culpably
illegible, but "Squire Bancroft" is just irregular
enough to be interesting though not unreadable.</p>

<p><i>Per contra</i>, I turn to one of the most legible
signatures in my possession. The writing is ugly
and the letters are ill-formed, looking rather like
the work of a hand which has only lately learned
to write and finds the act a difficulty. But it is
as clear as print, and it shows no adventitious
ornamentation or self-assertive twirls. The signature
is</p>

<p class="pi8 p1">"Yours most sincerely,</p>
<p class="pr8"><span class="smcap">Randolph S. Churchill</span>."</p>

<p class="pn1">In this case, if in no other, the oracles of Caligraphy
are set at naught. Here is a fine, twisty, twirling
hand, all tails and loops, but not at all unsightly.
The signature reads like "Lincoln," and only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
careful study would detect that the "L" of "Lincoln"
is preceded by a circular flourish which looks
like part of the L but is really a capital C. It is
the signature of that great scholar, Christopher
Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln; and I remember
that, in days of ecclesiastical strife, it was once
imputed to that apostolic man for vanity that he
signed his name "Lincoln" like a Temporal Peer.
From that day he defined the "C" more carefully.</p>

<p>To the last letter which I bring to light to-day
a different kind of interest attaches. It is dated</p>

<p class="pi6 p1">"<span class="smcap">Dingle Bank, Liverpool</span>,</p>
<p class="pi10"><i>April 13, 1888</i>."</p>

<p class="pn1">The writing is small and clear, with the upstrokes
and downstrokes rather long in comparison with
the level letters; but some small blurs and blots
show that the letter was written in unusual haste.
It ends with these words: "Smalley has written a
letter full of shriekings and cursings about my innocent
article; the Americans will get their notion
of it from that, and I shall never be able to enter
America again.</p>

<p class="pi8 p1">"Ever yours,</p>
<p class="pr8">M. A."</p>

<p class="pn1">This was the last letter which Matthew Arnold
ever wrote, and it closed a friendship which had
been one of the joys and glories of my life.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">CHRISTMAS</p>

<p>"Christmas, now," as Mr. Brooke in "Middlemarch"
might have said&mdash;"I went a good deal
into that kind of thing at one time; but I found
it would carry me too far&mdash;over the hedge, in
fact." That, I imagine, pretty well represents
the attitude of the adult world towards the feast
which closes the year. We all loved it when we
were young. Now, it is all very well for once in
a way; it might pall if frequently repeated; even
recurring only annually, it must be observed temperately
and enjoyed moderately. Anything resembling
excess would carry one too far&mdash;"over
the hedge, in fact." But, within these recognized
and salutary limits, Christmas is an institution
which I would not willingly let die. In the days
of my youth a Jewish lady caused me not a little
consternation by remarking that it seemed very
odd for Christians to celebrate the Feast of Redemption
with gluttony and drunkenness. She lived,
I am bound to say, in a very unregenerate village
in a remarkably savage part of the country, and
as, of course, she did not go to church, I dare say
that Gluttony and Drunkenness were the forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Christmas observance which most obtruded themselves
on her notice. Even Cardinal Newman
seems to have remarked the same phenomenon in
his youth, though he satirized it more delicately.
"Beneficed clergymen used to go to rest as usual
on Christmas-eve, and leave to ringers, or sometimes
to carollers, the observance which was paid,
<i>not without creature comforts</i>, to the sacred night."
Now all that is changed. Churches of all confessions
vie with one another in the frequency
and heartiness and picturesque equipment of
their religious services. Even the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
preaches Christmas sermons; and I very much
question whether the populace gets more drunk
at Christmas than at Easter. But, though we
may have learnt to celebrate the festival with rites
more devout and less bibulous, we have not yet
escaped my Jewish friend's reproach of gluttony.
The Christmas Dinner of the British Home is
still a thing imagination boggles at. The dreadful
pleasantries of the aged&mdash;their sorry gibes about
the doctor and the draught; hoary chestnuts about
little boys who stood up to eat more&mdash;remain
among the most terrible memories of the Christmas
dinner. And they were quite in keeping with the
dinner itself. I say nothing against the Turkey,
which (as my medical friends well know) was
found, by practical experiment in the case of
Alexis St. Martin, to be the most easily digested
of all animal foods, except venison; but surely, as a
nation, we eat quite beef enough in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the year without making Christmas an annual orgy
of carnivorous excess. I protest that the very
sight of the butchers' shops at this season of the
year is enough to upset a delicately balanced
organization. Rightly said the Shah, in that
immortal Diary which he kept during his visit to
England in 1873&mdash;"Meat is good, but it should
not be hung up in windows." Macaulay used to
say that Thackeray, in his famous description of
the Clapham sect in "The Newcomes," made
one blunder&mdash;he represented them as Dissenters,
whereas, in fact, they were rather dogged Church-people.
The only exception to the rule was a
Baptist lady, who, living on Clapham Common,
testified against the superstitions of the Established
Church by eating roast veal and apple-pie on
Christmas-day instead of more orthodox dainties.
Churchman though I am, I protest that I think
the Baptist lady was right: and I believe that the
Puritans were wiser than they knew when they
denounced Plum-Pudding and Mince Pies as inventions
of the Evil One. Yet the love of these
vindictive viands is one of the root-instincts of our
English nature. Forty-eight years ago the British
Army was keeping its Christmas in the Crimea,
amid all the horrors and hardships of a peculiarly
grim campaign. An English Sister of Mercy, who
was nursing under Miss Nightingale in the Hospital
at Scutari, thus described the melancholy festivity:
"The 'Roast Beef of Old England' was out of
the question, but with the aid of a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
imagination, it seemed possible at least to secure
the Plum Pudding. I think I might with safety
affirm that as the doctor left the ward every man
drew from under his pillow a small portion of
flour and fat, with an egg and some plums, and
began to concoct a Christmas pudding. I assisted
many to make the pudding, whom nothing short
of a miracle would enable to eat it; still they must
have the thing. For some days previously I had
been asked for pieces of linen, which, without
dreaming of the use to which they were to be
applied, I supplied. Thus were the pudding cloths
provided."</p>

<p>It can scarcely be conceived that these unhappy
soldiers, maddened by wounds and fever or perishing
by frost-bite and gangrene, can have had much
physical enjoyment in Christmas puddings made
of materials which had been concealed under their
sick pillows; in such circumstances the value of the
pudding is spiritual and symbolic. A few Christmases
ago I was assisting (in the literal sense) at a
dinner for starving "Dockers." A more broken,
jaded, and dejected crew it would be difficult to
picture. They had scarcely enough energy to eat
and drink, but lumbered slowly through their meal
of meat-pies and coffee without a smile and almost
without a word. All at once an unrehearsed feature
was introduced into the rather cheerless programme,
and a huge Plum Pudding, wreathed with holly
and flaming blue with burnt brandy, was borne
into the hall. A deep gasp of joy burst from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
assembled guests, and the whole company rose
as one man and greeted the joyous vision
with "Auld Lang Syne." The eating was yet to
come, so the exhilaration was purely moral.
The Pudding spoke at once to Memory and to
Hope.</p>

<p>There are other adjuncts of Christmas which
must by no means be overlooked&mdash;Christmas
presents, for instance, and Christmas amusements.
As to Christmas presents, I regard them as definite
means of grace. For weeks&mdash;sometimes months&mdash;before
Christmas returns we concentrate our
thought on our friends instead of ourselves. We
reflect on people's likes and dislikes, habits, tastes,
and occupations. We tax our ingenuity to find gifts
suitable for the recipients, and buy objects which
we think frankly hideous in the hope of gratifying
our unsophisticated friends. Happily the age of
ormolu and malachite has passed. We no longer
buy blotting-books made unusable by little knobs
of enamel on the cover; nor gilt-paper weights
which cost a hundred times more than the overweighted
letters of a lifetime could amount to.
Christmas gifts of this type belong to an unreturning
past, and, as Walter Pater said of the
wedding-present which he was expected to admire,
"Very rich, very handsome, very expensive, I'm
sure&mdash;but they mustn't make any more of them."
Nor will they. The standard of popular taste in
the matter of nick-nacks has improved as conspicuously
as in that of furniture; and the fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
shops, when spread for the Christmas market,
display a really large choice of presents which
one can buy without sacrificing self-respect, and
give without the appearance of insult.</p>

<p>But Christmas presents, even at a moderate
rate of charge, may, if one has a large circle of
acquaintance, carry one over the hedge, as Mr.
Brooke said; and here is the scope and function
of the Christmas Card. Few people have bought
more Christmas cards in a lifetime than the
present writer; and, out of a vast experience, he
would offer one word of friendly counsel to the
card-sender. Do not accumulate the cards which
you receive this Christmas and distribute them
among your friends next Christmas, for, if you
do, as sure as fate you will one day return a
card to the sender; and old friendships and
profitable connexions have been severed by such
miscarriages.</p>

<p>Of Christmas amusements I can say little. My
notion of them is chiefly derived from "Happy
Thoughts," where Byng suggests some "Christmassy
sort of thing" to amuse his guests, and
fails to gratify even his Half-Aunt. My infancy
was spent in the country, remote from Dances
and Theatres, Pantomimes and Panoramas. "The
Classic Walls of Old Drury" never welcomed me
on Boxing Night. Certainly a Christmas Tree
and a stocking full of presents appealed to that
acquisitive instinct which is fully as strong in
infancy as in old age; but, though exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
young in my time, I never was young enough to
be amused by a Snow-Man or dangerously excited
by Blind Man's Buff. Looking back, like Tennyson's
"many-wintered crow," on these Christmases
of infancy, I have sometimes asked myself
whether I lost much by my aloofness from the
normal merriment of youth. Mr. Anstey Guthrie
knows the secret heart of English boyhood more
accurately than most of us, and when I read his
description of a Christmas party I am inclined
to be thankful that my lot was cast a good many
miles beyond the cab-radius.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you come to our party on
Twelfth-night? We had great larks. I wish you'd
been there."</p>

<p>"I had to go to young Skidmore's instead,"
said a pale, spiteful-looking boy with fair hair,
carefully parted in the middle. "It was like his
cheek to ask me, but I thought I'd go, you know,
just to see what it was like."</p>

<p>"What was it like?" asked one or two near
him, languidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, awfully slow! They've a poky little
house in Brompton somewhere, and there was
no dancing, only boshy games and a conjuror,
without any presents. And, oh! I say, at supper
there was a big cake on the table, and no one
was allowed to cut it, because it was hired.
They're so poor, you know. Skidmore's pater is
only a clerk, and you should see his sisters!"</p>

<p>All my sympathies are with Skidmore, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
think that the fair-haired boy was an unmitigated
beast, and cad, and snob. But there is an awful
verisimilitude about "Boshy Games and a Conjuror,"
and I bless the fate which allowed me to
grow up in ignorance of Christmas Parties.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">NEW YEAR'S DAY</p>

<p>On the 1st of January 1882, Matthew Arnold
wrote to his sister: "I think the beginning of a
New Year very animating&mdash;it is so visible an
occasion for breaking off bad habits and carrying
into effect good resolutions." This was splendid
in a man who had just entered his sixtieth year,
and we all should like to share the sentiment;
but it is not always easy to feel "animated,"
even by the most significant anniversaries. Sometimes
they only depress; and the effect which
they produce depends so very largely on the
physical condition in which they find us. Suppose,
for instance, that one is a fox-hunter, in
the prime of life and the pride of health, with
a good string of horses which have been eating
their heads off during a prolonged frost. As
one wakes on New Year's morning, one hears
a delicious dripping from the roof, and one's
servant, coming in with tea and letters, announces
a rapid thaw. Then "the beginning of a New
Year" is "animating" enough; and, while we
wash and shave, we pledge ourselves, like Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Arnold, to "break off bad habits and carry into
effect good resolutions." We remember with
shame that we missed three capital days' hunting
last November because we let our friends seduce
us to their shooting-parties; and we resolve this
year to make up for lost time, to redeem wasted
opportunities, and not willingly to lose a day
between this and Christmas. Such resolutions
are truly "animating"; but we cannot all be
young or healthy or fox-hunters, and then the
anniversary takes a different colour. Perhaps
one is cowering over one's study-fire, with "an
air of romance struggling through the commonplace
effect of a swelled face" (like Miss Hucklebuckle
in "The Owlet"), or mumbling the minced
remains of our Christmas turkey as painfully as
Father Diggory in "Ivanhoe," who was "so
severely afflicted by toothache that he could only
eat on one side of his face." Not for us, in
such circumstances, are "animating" visions of
wide pastures, and negotiable fences, and too-fresh
hunters pulling one's arms off, and the
chime of the "dappled darlings down the roaring
blast." Rather does our New Year's fancy lightly
turn to thoughts of dentistry and doctoring. We
ask ourselves whether the time has not come
when art must replace what nature has withdrawn;
and, if we form a resolution, it is nothing more
heroic than that we will henceforward wear
goloshes in damp weather and a quilted overcoat
in frost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>But, it may be urged, Matthew Arnold was
not a fox-hunter (at least not after his Oxford
days), and yet he contrived to feel "animated"
by New Year's Day. In his case animation was
connected with books.</p>

<p>"I am glad," he wrote, "to find that in the past
year I have at least accomplished more than usual
in the way of reading the books which at the
beginning of the year I put down to be read. I
always do this, and I do not expect to read all
I put down, but sometimes I fall much too short
of what I proposed, and this year things have
been a good deal better. The importance of
reading, not slight stuff to get through the time
but the best that has been written, forces itself
upon me more and more every year I live. It
is living in good company, the best company,
and people are generally quite keen enough, or
too keen, about doing that; yet they will not
do it in the simplest and most innocent manner
by reading. If I live to be eighty, I shall probably
be the only person left in England who
reads anything but newspapers and scientific publications."</p>

<p>We have not quite come to that yet, but we are
not far off it, and I should fear that the number
of even educated people who occupy New Year's
Day in laying down a course of serious study for
the next twelve months is lamentably small. But
Hunting and Health and Books are not the only
topics for New Year's meditation. There is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Money, which not seldom obtrudes itself with a
disagreeable urgency. We cast our eye over that
little parchment-bound volume which only "Fortune's
favoured sons, not we" can regard with any
complacency; and we observe, not for the first
time, that we have been spending a good deal more
than we ought to spend, and are not far from the
perilous edge of an overdrawn account. This is
"animating" indeed, but only as a sudden stab
of neuralgia is animating; and we immediately
begin to consider methods of relief. But where
are our retrenchments to begin? That is always
the difficulty. I remember that after the Cattle
Plague of 1865, by which he had been a principal
sufferer, the first Lord Tollemache was very full
of fiscal reforms. "I ought to get rid of half my
servants; but they are excellent people, and it
would be very wrong to cause them inconvenience.
Horses, too&mdash;I really have no right to keep a stud.
But nothing would ever induce me to sell a horse,
and it seems rather heartless to kill old friends.
Then, again, about houses&mdash;I ought to leave St.
James's Square, and take a house in Brompton.
But the Brompton houses are so small that they
really would not accommodate my family, and it
would not be right to turn the boys into lodgings."
And so on and so forth, with a magnificent list of
contemplated reforms, which went unfulfilled till
things had righted themselves and retrenchment
was no longer necessary. In the same spirit, though
on a very different scale, the inhabitants of Stuccovia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
contemplate the financial future which lies
ahead of New Year's Day. We must economize&mdash;that
is plain enough. But how are we to begin?</p>

<p>I must have a new frock-coat very soon, and shall
want at least three tweed suits before the autumn.
Economy bids me desert Savile Row and try
Aaronson in New Oxford Street. "Budge," says the
Fiend. "Budge not," replies Self-Respect. Aaronson
is remarkable for a fit "that never was on sea
or land," and, though his garments are undeniably
cheap, they are also nasty, and are worn out before
they are paid for. Or perhaps our conscience
pricks us most severely in the matter of wine.
We will buy no more Pommery and Greno at 98s.
a dozen, but will slake our modest thirst with a
dry Sillery at 31s. But, after all, health is the first
consideration in life, and, unfortunately, these cheap
wines never agree with us. The doctor holds them
directly responsible for our last attack of eczema
or neuritis, and says impressively, "Drink good
wine, or none at all&mdash;bad wine is poison to you."
<i>Drink none at all.</i> That is very "animating," but
somehow our enfeebled will is unequal to the
required resolve; we hold spirit-drinking in detestation;
and so, after all, we are driven back
to our Pommery. "Surely," as Lamb said, "there
must be some other world in which our unconquerable
purpose" of retrenchment shall be
realized.</p>

<p>Travel, again. Many people spend too much
in travel. Can we curtail in that direction? For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
my own part, I am a Londoner, and am content
with life as it is afforded by this wonderful world
miscalled a city. But the Family has claims. Some
of them suffer from "Liver," and whoso knows
what it is to dwell with liverish patients will
not lightly run the risk of keeping them from
Carlsbad. Others can only breathe on high Alps,
and others, again, require the sunshine of the
Riviera or the warmth of the Italian Lakes. So
all the ways of retrenchment seem barred. Clothes
and wine and travel must cost as much as they
cost last year, and the only way of escape seems
to lie in the steps of the Prince Consort, who,
when Parliament reduced his income from the
proposed fifty thousand a year to thirty, patiently
observed that he should have to give less in
subscriptions.</p>

<p>To the Spendthrift, or even to the more modest
practitioner who merely lives up to his income,
the New Year, as we have seen, offers few opportunities
for resolutions of reform; but I fancy
that the Skinflint, and his cousin the Screw, find
it full of suggestive possibilities. I remember a
gentleman of "griping and penurious tendencies"
(the phrase is Mr. Gladstone's) telling me when
I was a schoolboy that he had resolved to spend
nothing with his tailor in the year then dawning.
He announced it with the air befitting a great
self-surrender, but I thought, as I looked at his
clothes, that he was really only continuing the
well-established practice of a lifetime. The Screw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of course, is of no one place or age; and here
is an excellent citation from the Diary of a
Screw&mdash;Mr. Thomas Turner&mdash;who flourished in
Sussex in the eighteenth century: "This being
New Year's Day, myself and wife at church in
the morning. Collection. My wife gave 6d. But,
they not asking me, I gave nothing. Oh! may
we increase in faith and good works, and maintain
the good intentions we have this day taken
up." Those who have tried it say that hoarding
is the purest of human pleasures; and I dare say
that by the end of the year good Mr. Turner's
banking-book was a phantom of delight.</p>

<p>All these reflections, and others like unto them,
came whirling on my mind this New Year's
Eve; and, just as I was beginning to reduce
them to form and figure, the shrill ting-ting of
the church-bell pierced the silence of the night.
<i>Watch-Night.</i> Those who are not the friends of
the English Church denounce her as hidebound,
immovable, and unreceptive. Here is the&mdash;or
an&mdash;answer to the charge. She has borrowed,
originally, from the Swedenborgians and more
immediately from the Wesleyans, a religious observance
which, though unrecognized in Prayer-book
or Kalendar, now divides with the Harvest
Festival the honour of being the most popular
service in the Church of England.</p>

<p>"Among the promptings of what may be
called, in the truest sense of the term, Natural
Religion, none surely is more instructive than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
that which leads men to observe with peculiar
solemnity the entrance upon a new year of life.
It is, if nothing else, the making a step in the
dark. It is the entrance upon a new epoch in
existence, of which the manifold "changes and
chances" prevent our forecasting the issue. True,
the line of demarcation is purely arbitrary; yet
there are few, even of the most thoughtless, who
can set foot across the line which separates one
year from another without feeling in some degree
the significance of the act. It would seem
that this passing season of thoughtfulness was
one of those opportunities which no form of
religion could afford to miss. And yet, for a
long time, that which may perhaps without
offence be termed Ecclesiasticism sternly refused
to recognize this occasion. The line was rigidly
drawn between the Civil New Year and the
Church's New Year. We were told that Advent
was the beginning of our Sacred Year, and that
the evening before the First Sunday in Advent
was the time for those serious thoughts and
good resolutions which rightly accompany a New
Year."</p>

<p>Yes-so we were taught; and there was a great
deal to be said, ecclesiastically, for the teaching.
Only, unfortunately, no one believed it. We
went to bed quite unmoved on Saturday evening,
December 1, 1906. No era seemed to have
closed for us, no era to have opened: there was
nothing to remember, nothing to anticipate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
nothing to repent and nothing to resolve. It is
otherwise to-night.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The "church-going bell"
does not tingle in vain. Old men and maidens,
young men and children are crowding in. I
involve myself in an ulster and a comforter, and
join the pilgrim-throng.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">PETS</p>

<p>My suggestive friend has taken to postcards, and
his style, never diffuse, has become as curt as
that of Mr. Alfred Jingle. "Why not Pets?" he
writes; and the suggestion gives pause.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Topham-Sawyer accepted the invitation
to the Little Dinner at Timmins's, she concluded
her letter to Rosa Timmins: "With a hundred kisses
to your dear little <i>pet</i>." She said <i>pet</i>, we are told,
"because she did not know whether Rosa's child
was a girl or a boy; and Mrs. Timmins was very
much pleased with the kind and gracious nature of
the reply to her invitation." My mind misgave me
that my friend might be using the word <i>pet</i> in the
same sense as Mrs. Topham-Sawyer, and inviting
me to a discussion of the Crêche or the Nursery.
As my views of childhood are formed on those of
Herod and Solomon, I hastened to decline so unsuitable
a task, whereupon my friend, for all reply,
sent me the following excerpt from an evening
paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Westminster Cat Exhibition, which will be
held in the Royal Horticultural Society's Hall,
Vincent Square, Westminster, on January 10 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
11, will afford an opportunity to all who love the
domestic cat to aid in improving its lot through the
agency of Our Dumb Friends' League, which it is
desired to benefit, not only by their presence on the
occasion, but by contributing suitable specimens to
the 'Gift Class' which will form part of the show,
and be offered for sale in aid of the League during
the time the exhibition is open. Children will be
invited, for the first time, to enter into the competition
with their pets for suitable prizes, and thus, it
is hoped, increase their interest in and affection for
domestic pets."</p>

<p>Here I felt myself on more familiar ground.
For I, too, have been young. I have trafficked in
squirrels and guinea-pigs, have invested my all in
an Angora rabbit, and have undergone discipline
for bringing a dormouse into school. These are,
indeed, among the childish things which I put away
when I became a Fifth Form boy; but their
memory is sweet&mdash;sweeter, indeed, than was their
actual presence. For the Cat, with which my friend
seems chiefly to concern himself, I have never felt,
or even professed, any warm regard. I leave her
to Dick Whittington and Shakespeare, who did so
much to popularize her; to Gray and Matthew
Arnold and "C. S. C.," who have drawn her more
sinister traits. Gray remarks, with reference to "the
pensive Selima" and her hopeless struggles in the
tub of goldfish, that "a favourite has no friend."
Archbishop Benson rendered the line</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Delicias dominæ cetera turba fugit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">I join the unfriendly throng, and pass to other
themes.</p>

<p>The pet-keeping instinct, strong in infancy but
suppressed by the iron traditions of the Public
School, not seldom reasserts itself in the freedom
of later life. "The Pets of History" would be a
worthy theme for a Romanes Lecture at Oxford;
and, if the purview were expanded so as to include
the Pets of Literature, it would be a fit subject for
the brilliant pen of Mr. Frederic Harrison. We
might conveniently adopt a Wordsworthian classification,
such as "Pets belonging to the period
of Childhood," "Juvenile Pets," "Pets and the
Affections," "Pets of the Fancy," and "Pets of the
Imagination." In the last-named class a prominent
place would be assigned to Heavenly Una's
milk-white lamb and to Mary's snowy-fleeced follower.
"Pets of the Fancy" has, I must confess,
something of a pugilistic sound, but it might fairly
be held to include the tame eagle which Louis
Napoleon, when resident in Carlton Gardens, used
to practise in the basement for the part which
it was to play in his descent on Boulogne.
Under "Pets and the Affections" we should recall
Chaucer's "Prioresse"&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Of smale houndes hadde sche, that sche fedde<br />
With rostud fleissh, and mylk, and wastel bredde."</p>

<p class="p1">The Pets of Tradition would begin with St.
John's tame partridge, and would include an account
of St. Francis preaching to the birds. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Pets of History would no doubt involve some
reference to the Bruce's spider and Sir Isaac
Newton's Diamond and the Duc D'Enghien's
spaniel; and, if so belittling a title as "pet" may
be applied to so majestic an animal as the horse,
we should trace a long line of equine celebrities
from Bucephalus and Sorrel to Marengo and
Copenhagen. The Pets of Literature are, of
course, a boundless host&mdash;chargers like White
Surrey, and coursers like Roland; hounds like
Keeldar and falcons like Cheviot&mdash;to say nothing
of Mrs. Merdle's parrot, or Miss Tox's canary, or
Mr. Kipling's appalling monkey, who murdered his
owner's wife.</p>

<p>Wordsworth alone is responsible for a whole
menagerie of pets&mdash;for a White Doe, for a greyhound
called Dart, for "Prince," "Swallow," and
"Little Music," let alone the anonymous dog
who was lost with his master on Helvellyn. The
gentle Cowper had his disgusting hares and his
murderous spaniel Beau. Byron's only friend was
a Newfoundland dog called Boatswain. The horses
of fiction are a splendid stud. Ruksh leads the
procession in poetry, and Rosinante in prose. A
true lover of Scott can enumerate twenty different
horses, of strongly marked individuality and
appropriate names. Whoso knows not Widderin
and his gallop from the bushrangers has yet to
read one of the most thrilling scenes in fiction;
and I think that to this imaginary stud may be
fairly added the Arabian mare which Lord Beaconsfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
thought he had ridden for thirty miles across
country in the strongly-enclosed neighbourhood
of Southend.</p>

<p>Among the Pets of Real Life an honourable
place belongs to Sir Walter Scott's deerhounds&mdash;were
not their names Bran and Maida?&mdash;and to
Lord Shaftesbury's donkey Coster. Loved in life
and honoured in death were Matthew Arnold's
dachshunds Geist and Max, his retriever Rover, his
cat Atossa, and, above all, his canary Matthias,
commemorated in one of the most beautiful of
elegiac poems. With Bismarck&mdash;not, one would
have thought, a natural lover of pets&mdash;is historically
associated a Boarhound, or "Great Dane."
Lord Beaconsfield characteristically loved a peacock.
The evening of Mr. Gladstone's days was
cheered by the companionship of a small black
Pomeranian. Sir Henry Hawkins was not better
known to the criminal classes than his fox-terrier
Jack; and all who passed Lady Burdett-Coutts's
house saw hanging in the dining-room window a
china cockatoo-the image or simulacrum of a
departed bird which lived to a prodigious age and
used to ask the most inconvenient questions.</p>

<p>The greatest patroness of Pets in Real Life was
Queen Victoria, and her books have secured for
these favourites a permanent place. Noble, the
collie, will be remembered as long as "Leaves
from the Journal of our Life in the Highlands"
is read; and I can myself recall the excitement
which fluttered the highest circles when a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
terrier, called, I think, Sharp, killed a rat which
had climbed up the ivy into the window of the
Queen's sitting-room at Windsor.</p>

<p>There are certain pets, or families of pets, which
stand on their own traditional dignity rather than
on associations with individuals. All Cheshire
knows the Mastiffs of Lyme, tall as donkeys and
peaceable as sheep. The Clumber Spaniels and
the Gordon Setters are at least as famous as the
dukes who own them. Perhaps the most fascinating
pet in the canine world is associated with
the great victory of Blenheim; and the Willoughby
Pug preserves from oblivion a name which has
been merged in the Earldom of Ancaster.</p>

<p>In the days of my youth one was constantly
hearing&mdash;and especially in the Whiggish circles
where I was reared&mdash;two names which may easily
puzzle posterior critics. These were "Bear Ellis"
and "Poodle Byng." They were pre-eminently
unsentimental persons. "Bear" Ellis (1781-1863)
was so called because he was Chairman of the
Hudson's Bay Company, and "Poodle" Byng
(1784-1871) because his hair, while yet he boasted
such an appendage, had been crisply curled. But
the Dryasdust of the future, pondering over the
social and political records of Queen Victoria's
earlier reign, will undoubtedly connect these prefixes
with pet-keeping tendencies, and will praise
the humane influence of an animal-loving Court
which induced hardened men of the world to join
the ranks of "Our Dumb Friends' League."</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXIX</h2>

<p class="pch">PURPLE AND FINE LINEN</p>

<p>Dean <i>versus</i> Bishop&mdash;it is an antinomy as old as
the history of Cathedral institutions. The Dean,
with a good house and a thousand a year, has
always murmured against the Bishop, with a
better house and five times that income; and,
as he is generally master of his Cathedral, he
has before now contrived to make his murmurs
sensible as well as audible. Of late years these
spiritual strifes (which beautifully link the post-Reformation
to the pre-Reformation Church) have
been voted disedifying, and, if they continue to
exist, they operate surreptitiously and out of public
view. But, though Deans have ceased from clamouring,
they retain their right to criticize, and
the Dean of Norwich has just been exercising that
right with a good deal of vivacity. I cull the
following extract from a secular newspaper:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="smcap">Simple Life for Bishops</span></h3>

<p class="p1">"Dean Lefroy at a meeting of the General
Diocesan Committee to make arrangements for
the Church Congress at Great Yarmouth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
October ... commented on the inordinate expense
of founding bishoprics, and said that
episcopacy in Canterbury Province cost £142,000
per annum, and in York £44,000. He believed
that £2000 a year and a residence would be
welcome to most bishops. The upkeep of large
palaces swallowed up the bishops' incomes.
Preserve the palaces, but give bishops the opportunity
of living more simply. The surplus might
go to poor and starving clergy."</p>

<p>One can picture the tempered gratitude with
which the Bishops, and the ladies of the Episcopal
household, and the Domestic Chaplains&mdash;those
"amiable young gentlemen who make
themselves agreeable in the drawing-rooms of
the Mitre"&mdash;must regard this obliging invitation
to "live more simply." There is a good deal
of human nature even in apostolic bosoms, and
a man who has enjoyed an official income of
£5000 a year does not as a rule regard with
enthusiasm a reduction to £2000. The Bishop
in "Little Dorrit," when the guests at Mr. Merdle's
banquet were extolling their host's
opulence, "tried to look as if he was rather
poor himself"; and his successors at the present
day take great pains to assure the public that
they are not overpaid. The <i>locus classicus</i> on
the subject of episcopal incomes is to be found
in the Rev. Hubert Handley's book called "The
Fatal Opulence of Bishops," and was originally
supplied by the artless candour of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Bishop of London, who in the year 1893 published
in the <i>Oxford House Chronicle</i> a statistical
statement by an unnamed Bishop. This prelate
had only a beggarly income of £4200, and must
therefore be the occupant of one of those comparatively
cheap and humble Sees which the
exigencies of the Church have lately called into
being. Out of this pittance he had to pay £1950
for a removal, furniture, and repairs to the
episcopal residence. This, to the lay mind, seems
a good deal. Hospitality he sets down as costing
£2000 a year; but somehow one feels as if
one could give luncheon to the country clergy,
and satisfy even the craving appetites of ordinands,
at a less cost. "Stables," says the good Bishop,
"are almost a necessity, and in some respects
a saving;" but here the haughty disregard of
details makes criticism difficult. "Robes, £100."
This item is plain enough and absurd enough.
The perverted ingenuity of fallen man has never
devised a costume more hideous or less expressive
than the episcopal "magpie"; and I
am confident that Mrs. Bishop's maid could
have stitched together the necessary amounts of
lawn and black satin at a less cost than £100.
But this exactly illustrates the plan on which
these episcopal incomes are always defended by
their apologists. We are told precisely what the
Bishop expends on each item of charge. But
we are not told, and are quite unable to divine,
why each of those items should cost so much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
or why some of them should ever be incurred.
The Bishop of London (then Mr. Winnington-Ingram)
thus summed up the statement of his
episcopal friend in the background: "It amounts
to this&mdash;a bishop's income is a trust-fund for the
diocese which head ministers. It would make no
difference to him personally if three-quarters of
it were taken away, so long as three-quarters
of his liabilities were taken away too; and it
is quite arguable that this would be a better
arrangement."</p>

<p>Certainly it is "quite arguable"; but is it equally
certain that the change "would make no difference
to the Bishop personally"? I doubt it. Married
men, men with large families and plenty of
servants, naturally prefer large houses to small,
provided that there is an income to maintain
them. Men who enjoy the comforts and prettinesses
of life prefer an income which enables
them to repair and furnish and beautify their
houses to an income which involves faded wallpaper
and battered paint. Men of hospitable
instincts are happier in a system which enables
them to spend £2000 a year on entertaining
than they would be if they were compelled to
think twice of the butcher's bill and thrice of the
wine-merchant's. Men who like horses&mdash;and few
Englishmen do not&mdash;naturally incline to regard
"stables as a necessity," and even as "in some
respects"&mdash;what respects?&mdash;"a saving." If their
income were reduced to the figure suggested by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Dean Lefroy, they would find themselves under
the bitter constraint (as Milton calls it) of doing
without a "necessity," and must even forgo an
outlay which is "in some respects a saving."</p>

<p>Again, the anonymous Bishop returned his outlay
in subscriptions at a fraction over £400 a
year. I do not presume to say whether this is
much or little out of an income of £4000. At
any rate it is a Tithe, and that is a respectable
proportion. But, supposing that our Bishop is a
man of generous disposition, who loves to relieve
distress and feels impelled to give a lift
to every good cause which asks his aid, he is of
necessity a happier man while he draws £4000 a
year than he would be if cut down by reforming
Deans to £2000.</p>

<p>I venture, then, with immense deference to
that admirable divine who is now Bishop of
London, to dissent emphatically from his judgment,
recorded in 1895, that the diminution of episcopal
incomes, if accompanied by a corresponding
diminution of episcopal charges, would "make
no difference to the Bishop personally." I
conceive that it would make a great deal of
difference, and that, though spiritually salutary,
it would be, as regards temporal concerns, one
of those experiments which one would rather
try on one's neighbour than on oneself.</p>

<p>An ingenious clergyman who shared Dean
Lefroy's and Mr. Handley's views on episcopal incomes,
and had an inconvenient love of statistics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
made a study at the Probate Office of the personalty
left by English Bishops who died between
1855 and 1885. The average was £54,000, and the
total personalty something more than two millions
sterling. "This was exclusive of any real estate
they may have possessed, and exclusive of any
sums invested in policies of life-assurance or
otherwise settled for the benefit of their families."
Myself no lover of statistics or of the extraordinarily
ill-ventilated Will-room at Somerset
House, I am unable to say how far the episcopal
accumulations of the last twenty years may have
affected the total and the average. It is only
fair to remember that several of the Bishops
who died between 1855 and 1885 dated from the
happy days before the Ecclesiastical Commission
curtailed episcopal incomes, and may have had
ten, or fifteen, or twenty thousand a year. On
the other hand, it is to be borne in mind that,
since Sir William Harcourt's Budget, the habit
of "dodging the death-duties" has enormously
increased, and has made it difficult to know what
a testator, episcopal or other, really possessed.
But it is scarcely possible to doubt that, if the
public were permitted to examine all the episcopal
pass-books, we should find that, in spite of the
exactions of upholsterers and furniture-removers,
butchers and bakers, robe-makers and horse-dealers,
the pecuniary lot of an English Bishop
is, to borrow a phrase of Miss Edgeworth's,
"vastly put-up-able with."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Just after Mr. Bright had been admitted to the
Cabinet, and when the more timid and more
plausible members of his party hoped that he
would begin to curb his adventurous tongue,
he attended a banquet of the Fishmongers' Company
at which the Archbishops and Bishops
were entertained. The Archbishop of York (Dr.
Thomson) said in an after-dinner speech that the
Bishops were the most liberal element in the
House of Lords, seeing that they were the only
peers created for life. This statement Mr. Bright,
speaking later in the evening, characterized as
an excess of hilarity; "though," he added, "it
is possible that, with a Bishop's income, I might
have been as merry as any of them, with an
inexhaustible source of rejoicing in the generosity,
if not in the credulity, of my countrymen." To
this outrageous sally the assembled prelates could,
of course, only reply by looking as dignified (and
as poor) as they could; and no doubt the general
opinion of the Episcopal Bench is that they are
an overworked and ill-remunerated set of men.</p>

<p>Yet there have been Apostles, and successors
of the Apostles, who worked quite as hard and
were paid considerably less, and yet succeeded in
winning and retaining the affectionate reverence
of their own and of succeeding generations.
Bishop Wilson of Sodor and Man lived, we are
told, on an income which "did not exceed £300
a year." By far the most dignified ecclesiastic
with whom I was ever brought in contact&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
true "Prince of the Church" if ever there was
one&mdash;was Cardinal Manning, and his official income
was bounded by a figure which even the reforming
spirit of Dean Lefroy would reject as miserably
insufficient. "It is pleasant," wrote Sydney
Smith, "to loll and roll and accumulate&mdash;to be
a purple-and-fine-linen man, and to be called by
some of those nicknames which frail and ephemeral
beings are so fond of heaping upon each
other,&mdash;but the best thing of all is to live like
honest men, and to add something to the cause
of liberality, justice, and truth." It is no longer
easy for a Bishop to "loll and roll"&mdash;the bicycle
and the motor-car are enemies to tranquil ease&mdash;and,
if Dean Lefroy's precept and Bishop Gore's
example are heeded, he will find it equally difficult
to "accumulate."</p>

<p class="pch">PRELACY AND PALACES</p>

<p>That delicious prelate whom I have already
quoted, but whose name and See are unkindly
withheld from us by the Bishop of London, thus
justified his expenditure on hospitality: "<i>Palace</i>,
I am told, is from <i>Palatium</i>, 'the open house,' and
there is almost daily entertainment of clergy and
laity from a distance." I will not presume to
question the episcopal etymology; for, whether it
be sound or unsound, the practical result is equally
good. We have apostolic authority for holding
that Bishops should be given to hospitality, and it
is satisfactory to know that the travel-worn clergy
and laity of the anonymous diocese are not sent
empty away. But would not the boiled beef and
rice pudding be equally acceptable and equally
sustaining if eaten in some apartment less majestic
than the banqueting-hall of a Palace? Would
not the Ecclesiastical Commissioners be doing a
good stroke of business for the Church if they
sold every Episcopal Palace in England and provided
the evicted Bishops with moderate-sized and
commodious houses?</p>

<p>These are questions which often present themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to the lay mind, and the answer usually
returned to them involves some very circuitous
reasoning. The Bishops, say their henchmen,
must have large incomes because they have to live
in Palaces; and they must live in Palaces&mdash;I
hardly know why, but apparently because they
have large incomes. Such reasoning does not
always convince the reformer's mind, though it
is repeated in each succeeding generation with
apparent confidence in its validity. After all, there
is nothing very revolutionary in the suggestion
that Episcopal palaces should be, in the strictest
sense of the word, confiscated. Sixty-four years
ago Dr. Hook, who was not exactly an iconoclast,
wrote thus to his friend Samuel Wilberforce: "I
really do not see how the Church can fairly ask
the State to give it money for the purpose of giving
a Church education, when the money is to be
supplied by Dissenters and infidels and all classes
of the people, who, according to the principles of
the Constitution, have a right to control the expenditure.
The State can only, if consistent, give
an infidel education; it cannot employ public
money to give a Church education, because of the
Dissenters; nor a Protestant education, because
of the Papists; and have not Jews, Turks, and
infidels as much a right as heretics to demand
that the education should not be Christian?"
This strikes me as very wholesome doctrine, and,
though enounced in 1843, necessary for these
times. And, when he turns to ways and means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Dr. Hook is equally explicit: "If we are to educate
the people in Church principles, the education
must be out of Church funds. We want not
proud Lords, haughty Spiritual Peers, to be our
Bishops. Offer four thousand out of their five
thousand a year for the education of the people.
Let Farnham Castle and Winchester House and
Ripon Palace be sold, and we shall have funds
to establish other Bishoprics.... You see I am
almost a Radical, for I do not see why our
Bishops should not become as poor as Ambrose
or Augustine, that they may make the people
really rich." It is not surprising that Samuel
Wilberforce, who had already climbed up several
rungs of the ladder of promotion, and as he himself
tells us, "had often talked" of further elevation,
met Dr. Hook's suggestions with solemn
repudiation. "I <i>do</i> think that we want Spiritual
Peers." "I see no reason why the Bishops' Palaces
should be sold, which would not apply equally
to the halls of our squires and the palaces of
our princes." "To impoverish our Bishops and
sell their Palaces would only be the hopeless
career of revolution."</p>

<p>The real reason for selling the Episcopal Palaces
is that, in plain terms, they are too big and too
costly for their present uses. They afford a
plausible excuse for paying the Bishops more
highly than they ought to be paid; and yet the
Bishops turn round and say that even the comfortable
incomes which the Ecclesiastical Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
has assigned them are unequal to the
burden of maintaining the Palaces. The late
Bishop Thorold, who was both a wealthy and a
liberal man, thus bemoaned his hard fate in
having to live at Farnham Castle: "It will give
some idea of what the furnishing of this house
from top to bottom meant if I mention that the
stairs, with the felt beneath, took just a mile
and 100 yards of carpet, with 260 brass stair-rods;
and that, independently of the carpet in
the great hall, the carpets used elsewhere absorbed
1414 yards&mdash;a good deal over three-quarters
of a mile. As to the entire amount of roof,
which in an old house requires constant watching,
independently of other parts of the building,
it is found to be, on measurement, 32,000 superficial
feet, or one acre and one-fifth." What is
true of Farnham is true, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of
Bishopthorpe with its hundred rooms, and Auckland
Castle with its park, and Rose Castle with
its woodlands, and Lambeth with its tower and
guard-room and galleries and gardens. Even the
smaller Palaces, such as the "Moated Grange"
of Wells, are not maintained for nothing. "My
income goes in pelargoniums," growled Bishop
Stubbs, as he surveyed the conservatories of
Cuddesdon. "It takes ten chaps to keep this
place in order," ejaculated a younger prelate as
he skipped across his tennis-ground.</p>

<p>Of course the root of the mischief is that these
Palaces were built and enlarged in the days when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
each See had its own income, and when the incomes
of such Sees as Durham and Winchester
ran to twenty or thirty thousand a year. The poor
Sees&mdash;and some were very poor&mdash;had Palaces proportioned
to their incomes, and very unpalatial
they were. "But now," as Bertie Stanhope said
to the Bishop of Barchester at Mrs. Proudie's
evening party, "they've cut them all down to
pretty nearly the same figure," and such buildings
as suitably accommodated the princely retinues
of Archbishop Harcourt (who kept one valet on
purpose to dress his wigs) and Bishop Sumner
(who never went from Farnham Castle to the
Parish Church except in a coach-and-four) are
"a world too wide for the shrunk shanks" of
their present occupants.</p>

<p>In the Palace of Ely there is a magnificent
gallery, which once was the scene of a memorable
entertainment. When Bishop Sparke secured a
Residentiary Canonry of Ely for his eldest son, the
event was so completely in the ordinary course of
things that it passed without special notice. But,
when he planted his second son in a second
Canonry, he was, and rightly, so elated by the
achievement that he entertained the whole county
of Cambridge at a ball in his gallery. But in those
days Ely was worth £11,000 a year, and we are not
likely to see a similar festival. Until recent years
the Archbishop of Canterbury had a suburban
retreat from the cares of Lambeth, at Addington,
near Croydon, where one of the ugliest mansions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in Christendom stood in one of the prettiest parks.
Archbishop Temple, who was a genuine reformer,
determined to get rid of this second Palace and
take a modest house near his Cathedral. When
he asked the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to sanction
this arrangement, they demurred. "Do you
think," they asked, "that your successors will wish
to live at Canterbury?" "No, <i>I don't</i>" replied
the Archbishop, with indescribable emphasis, "<i>and
so I'm determined they shall</i>."</p>

<p>If every Bishop who is saddled with an inconveniently
large house were in earnest about getting
rid of it, the Ecclesiastical Commission could
soon help him out of his difficulty. Palaces of no
architectural or historical interest could be thrown
into the market, and follow the fate of Riseholme,
once the abode of the Bishops of Lincoln. Those
Palaces which are interesting or beautiful, or in
any special sense heirlooms of the Church, could
be converted into Diocesan Colleges, Training
Colleges, Homes for Invalid Clergymen, or Houses
of Rest for such as are overworked and broken
down. By this arrangement the Church would
be no loser, and the Bishops, according to their
own showing, would be greatly the gainers. £5000
a year, or even a beggarly four, will go a long
way in a villa at Edgbaston or a red-brick house
in Kennington Park; and, as the Bishops will no
longer have Palaces to maintain, they will no
doubt gladly accept still further reductions at the
hands of reformers like Dean Lefroy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be a sad pity if these contemplated
reductions closed the <i>Palatium</i> or "open house"
against the hungry flock; but, if they only check
the more mundane proclivities of Prelacy, no
harm will be done. One of the most spendidly
hospitable prelates who ever adorned the Bench
was Archbishop Thomson of York, and this is
Bishop Wilberforce's comment on what he saw
and heard under the Archiepiscopal roof: "Dinner
at Archbishop of York's. A good many Bishops,
both of England and Ireland, and not one word
said which <i>implied</i> we were apostles." Perhaps
it will be easier to keep that fact in remembrance,
when to apostolic succession is added
the grace of apostolic poverty.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XLI</h2>

<p class="pch">HORRORS</p>

<p>The subject is suggested to me by the notice-board
outside the Court Theatre. There I learn
that "The Campden Wonder" has run its course.
A "horror" of the highest excellence has been
on view for four weeks; and I, who might have
revelled in it, have made, <i>per viltate</i>, the Great
Refusal. I leave the italicized quality untranslated,
because I am not quite sure of the English
equivalent which would exactly suit my case.
"Vileness" is a little crude. "Cowardice" is
ignominious. "Poorness of Spirit "is an Evangelical
virtue. "Deficiency of Enterprise" and
"an impaired nervous system" would, at the
best, be paraphrases rather than translations. On
the whole, I think the nearest approximation to
the facts of my case is to say that my refusal to
profit by Mr. Masefield's Horror was due to Decadence.
<i>Fuimus.</i> There has been a period when
such a tale as the "Campden Wonder" would
have attracted me with an irresistible fascination
and gripped me with a grasp of iron. But I am
not the man I was; and I am beginning to share
the apprehensions of the aged lady who told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
doctor that she feared she was breaking up, for
she could no longer relish her Murders.</p>

<p>Youth, and early youth, is indeed the Golden
Age of Horrors. To a well-constituted child
battle and murder and sudden death appeal far
more powerfully than any smooth tale of love.
We snatch a fearful joy from the lurid conversation
of servants and neighbours. We gaze, with
a kind of panic-stricken rapture, at the stain on
the floor which marks the place where old Mr.
Yellowboy was murdered for his money; and
run very fast, though with a backward gaze, past
the tree on which young Rantipole hanged himself
on being cut off with a shilling by his uncle
Mr. Wormwood Scrubbs. In some privileged
families the children are not left to depend on
circumjacent gossip, but are dogmatically instructed
in hereditary horrors. This happy lot
was mine. My father's uncle had been murdered
by his valet; and from a very tender age I
could have pointed out the house where the
murder took place&mdash;it went cheap for a good
many years afterwards,&mdash;and could have described
the murderer stripping himself naked before he
performed the horrid act, and the bath of blood
in which the victim was found, and the devices
employed to create an impression of suicide
instead of murder. I could have repeated the
magnificent peroration in which the murderer's
advocate exhorted the jury to spare his client's
life (and which, forty years later, was boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
plagiarized by Mr. Montagu Williams in defending
Dr. Lamson). The murderer, Benjamin Francis
Courvoisier by name, long occupied a conspicuous
place in Madame Tussaud's admirable collection.
I can distinctly recall a kind of social eminence
among my schoolfellows which was conferred by
the fact that I had this relationship with the
Chamber of Horrors; and I was conscious of a
painful descent when Courvoisier lapsed out of
date and was boiled down into Mr. Cobden or
Cardinal Wiseman or some other more recent
celebrity. Then, again, all literature was full of
Horrors; and, though we should have been
deprived of jam at tea if we had been caught
reading a Murder Trial in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, we
were encouraged to drink our fill of Shakespeare
and Scott and Dickens and other great masters
of the Horrible. From De Quincey we learned
that Murder may be regarded as a Fine Art, and
from an anonymous poet we acquired the immortal
verse which narrates the latter end of Mr.
William Weare. Shakespeare, as his French critics
often remind us, reeks of blood and slaughter;
the word "Murder" and its derivatives occupy
two columns of Mrs. Cowden Clarke's closely-printed
pages. Scott's absolute mastery over his
art is nowhere more strikingly exemplified than
in his use of murderous mechanisms. "The
Heart of Midlothian" begins, continues, and ends
with murder. "Rob Roy" contains a murder-scene
of lurid beauty. The murderous attack on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the bridegroom in "The Bride of Lammermoor"
is a haunting horror. Not all the Dryasdusts in
England and Germany combined will ever displace
the tradition of Amy Robsart and the concealed
trap-door. Front-de-B&oelig;uf's dying agony
is to this hour a glimpse of hell. Greatest of
the great in humour, Dickens fell not far behind
the greatest when he turned his hand to Horrors.
One sheds few tears for Mr. Tulkinghorn, and
we consign Jonas Chuzzlewit to the gallows
without a pang. But is there in fiction a more
thrilling scene than the arrest of the murderer
on the moonlit tower-stair in "Barnaby Rudge,"
or the grim escape of Sikes from the vengeance
of the mob in "Oliver Twist"? For deliberate,
minute, and elaborated horror commend me to
the scene at the limekiln on the marshes where
Pip awaits his horrible fate at the hands of the
crazy savage Dolge Orlick.</p>

<p>But it was not only the great masters of
fiction who supplied us with our luxuries of
horror. The picture of the young man who
had murdered his brother, hanging on a gibbet
in Blackgrove Wood, is painted with a gruesome
fidelity of detail which places Mrs. Sherwood
high among literary artists; and the incidents
connected with the death of Old Prue would
entitle Mrs. Beecher Stowe to claim kinship
with Zola.</p>

<p>It is curious to reflect that Miss Braddon,
the most cheerful and wholesome-minded of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
all living novelists, first won her fame by imagining
the murderous possibilities of a well, and established
it by that unrivalled mystification which
confounds the murderer and the murdered in
"Henry Dunbar." Nor will the younger generation
of authoresses consent to be left behind
in the race of Horrors. In old days we were
well satisfied if we duly worked up to our
predestined murder just before the end of the
third volume. To-day Lady Ridley gives us, in
the first chapter of "A Daughter of Jael," one
of the most delicate and suggestive pieces of
murder-writing which I, a confirmed lover of the
horrible, can call to mind.</p>

<p>To a soul early saturated with literary horrors
the experience of life is a curious translation of
fancy into fact. Incidents which have hitherto
appeared visionary and imaginative now take the
character of substantial reality. We discover
that horrors are not confined to books or to a
picturesque past, but are going on all round
us; and the discovery is fraught with an uneasy
joy. When I recall the illusions of my infancy
and the facts which displaced them, I feel that
I fall miserably below the ideal of childhood
presented in the famous "Ode on the Intimations
of Immortality." My "daily travel further from
the East" is marked by memories of dreadful
deeds, and the "vision splendid" which attends
me on my way is a vivid succession of peculiarly
startling murders. In the dawn of consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
these visions have "something of celestial light"
about them&mdash;they are spiritual, impalpable, ideal.
At length the youth perceives them die away,
"and melt into the light of common day"&mdash;very
common day indeed, the day of the Old
Bailey and the <i>Police News</i>. By a curious chain
of coincidences, I was early made acquainted
with the history of that unfriendly Friend John
Tawell, who murdered his sweetheart with prussic
acid, and was the first criminal to be arrested
by means of the electric telegraph. Heroic was
the defence set up by Sir Fitzroy Kelly, who
tried to prove that an inordinate love of eating
apples, pips and all, accounted for the amount
of prussic acid found in the victim's body. Kelly
lived to be Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer,
but the professional nickname of "Apple-pip
Kelly" stuck to him to the end. I know the
house where Tawell lived; I have sat under the
apple-tree of which his victim ate; and I have
stood, the centre of a roaring election crowd, on
the exact spot outside the Court-house at Aylesbury
where he expiated his crime.</p>

<p>Tawell belongs, if I may so say, to a pre-natal
impression. But, as the 'sixties of the last century
unroll their record, each page displays its peculiar
Horror. In 1860 Constance Kent cut her little
brother's throat, and buried him in the back-yard.
Many a night have I lain quaking in my bed,
haunted by visions of sisters armed with razors,
and hurried graves in secret spots. Not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
more cheering was the nocturnal vision of Thomas
Hopley, schoolmaster, of Eastbourne, convicted
in 1860 of flogging a half-witted pupil to death
with a skipping-rope, and afterwards covering
the lacerated hands with white kid gloves. I
confess to a lasting distaste for private schools,
founded on this reminiscence. "The Flowery
Land" is a title so prettily fanciful, so suffused
with the glamour of the East, that one would
scarcely expect to connect it with piracy, murder,
and a five-fold execution. Yet that is what it
meant for youthful horror-mongers in 1864. In
1865 the plan which pleased my childish thought
was that pursued by Dr. Pritchard of Glasgow,
who, while he was slowly poisoning his wife
and his mother-in-law, kept a diary of their
sufferings and recorded their deliverance from
the burden of the flesh with pious unction. Two
years later a young ruffian, whose crime inspired
Mr. James Rhoades to write a passionate poem,
cut a child into segments, and recorded in his
journal&mdash;"Saturday, August 24, 1867: Killed a
young girl; it was fine and hot."</p>

<p>One might linger long in these paths of dalliance,
but space forbids; and memory clears nine years
at a bound. Most vivid, most fascinating, most
human, if such an epithet be permitted in such
a context, was the "Balham Mystery" of 1876.
Still I can feel the cob bolting with me across
Tooting Common; still I lave my stiffness in a
hot bath, and tell the butler that it will do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
a cold bath to-morrow; still I plunge my carving-knife
into the loin of lamb, and fill up the
chinks with that spinach and those eggs; still I
quench my thirst with that Burgundy, of <i>which
no drop remained in the decanter</i>; and still I wake
up in the middle of the night to find myself
dying in torture by antimonial poisoning.</p>

<p>But we have supped full on horrors. Good
night, and pleasant dreams.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XLII</h2>

<p class="pch">SOCIAL CHANGES</p>

<p>I have been invited to make some comments on
recent changes in society, and I obey the call,
though not without misgiving. "Society" in its
modern extension is so wide a subject that probably
no one can survey more than a limited
portion of its area; and, if one generalizes too
freely from one's own experience, one is likely to
provoke the contradictions of critics who, surveying
other portions, have been impressed by different,
and perhaps contrary, phenomena. All such
contradictions I discount in advance. After all,
one can only describe what one has seen, and my
equipment for the task entrusted to me consists
of nothing more than a habit of observation and
a retentive memory.</p>

<p>I was brought up in that "sacred circle of the
Great-Grandmotherhood" of which Mr. Beresford-Hope
made such excellent fun in "Strictly Tied
Up." As Mr. Squeers considered himself the
"right shop for morals," so the Whigs considered
themselves the right shop for manners. What
they said and did every one ought to say and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
do, and from their judgment there was no appeal.
A social education of this kind leaves traces
which time is powerless to efface&mdash;"<i>Vieille école,
bonne école, begad!</i>" as Major Pendennis said.
In twenty-five years' contact with a more enlarged
society, one has found a perpetual interest in
watching the departure, gradual but nearly universal,
from the social traditions of one's youth.
The contrast between Now and Then is constantly
reasserting itself; and, if I note some instances of
it just as they occur to my mind, I shall be
doing, at any rate in part, what has been required
of me.</p>

<p>I will take the most insignificant instances first&mdash;instances
of phrase and diction and pronunciation.
I am just old enough to remember a greatgrandmother
who said that she "lay" at a place
when she meant that she had slept there, and
spoke of "using the potticary" when we should
speak of sending for the doctor. Some relations
of a later generation said "ooman" for woman,
and, when they were much obliged, said they were
much "obleeged." "Brarcelet" for bracelet and
"di'monds" for diamonds were common pronunciations.
Tuesday was "Toosday," and first
was "fust." Chariot was "charr'ot," and Harriet
"Harr'yet," and I have even heard "Jeames" for
James. "Goold" for gold and "yaller" for yellow
were common enough. Stirrups were always
called "sturrups," and squirrels "squrrels," and
wrapped was pronounced "wropped," and tassels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
"tossels," and Gertrude "Jertrude." A lilac was
always called a "laylock," and a cucumber a
"cowcumber." The stress was laid on the second
syllable of balcony, even as it is written in the
"Diverting History of John Gilpin":&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"At Edmonton his loving wife<br />
From the balcony spied</p>
<p class="pin4">Her tender husband, wondering much<br />
To see how he did ride."</p>

<p class="pn1"><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Cowper was a Whig.</p>

<p>Of course, these archaisms were already passing
away when I began to notice them, but some of
them survive until this hour, and only last winter,
after an evening service in St. Paul's Cathedral, I
was delighted to hear a lady, admiring the illuminated
dome, exclaim, "How well the doom
looks!"</p>

<p>Then, again, as regards the names of places. I
cannot profess to have heard "Lunnon," but I
have heard the headquarters of my family called
"'Ooburn," and Rome "Roome," and Sèvres
"Saver," and Falmouth "Farmouth," and Penrith
"Peerith," and Cirencester "Ciciter."</p>

<p>Nowadays it is as much as one can do to get a
cabman to take one to Berwick Street or Berkeley
Square, unless one calls them Berwick or Burkley.
Gower Street and Pall Mall are pronounced as they
are spelt; and, if one wants a ticket for Derby, the
booking-clerk obligingly corrects one's request to
"Durby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>And, as with pronunciation, so also with phrase
and diction&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Change and decay in all around I see."</p>

<p class="p1">When I was young the word "lunch," whether
substantive or verb, was regarded with a peculiar
horror, and ranked with "'bus" in the lowest depths
of vulgarity. To "take" in the sense of eat or
drink was another abomination which lay too deep
for words. "You take exercise or take physic;
nothing else," said Brummel to the lady who asked
him to take tea. "I beg your pardon, you also
take a liberty," was the just rejoinder.</p>

<p>I well remember that, when the journals of an
Illustrious Person were published and it appeared
that a royal party had "taken luncheon" on a hill,
it was stoutly contended in Whig circles that the
servants had taken the luncheon to the hill where
their masters ate it; and, when a close examination
of the text proved this gloss to be impossible, it was
decided that the original must have been written in
German, and that it had been translated by some one
who did not know the English idiom. To "ride,"
meaning to travel in a carriage, was, and I hope
still is, regarded as the peculiar property of my
friend Pennialinus;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and I remember the mild sensation
caused in a Whig house when a neighbour
who had driven over to luncheon declined to wash
her hands on the ground that she had "ridden in
gloves." The vehicle which was invented by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Lord Chancellor and called after his name was
scrupulously pronounced so as to rhyme with
groom, and any one indiscreet enough to say that
he had ridden in "the Row" would probably have
been asked if he had gone round by "the Zoo."</p>

<p>"Cherry pie and apple pie; all the rest are tarts,"
was an axiom carefully instilled into the young
gastronomer; while "to pass" the mustard was
bound in the same bundle of abominations as "I'll
trouble you," "May I assist you?" "Not any,
thank you," and "A very small piece."</p>

<p>Then, again, as to what may be called the
Manners of Eating. A man who put his elbows
on the table would have been considered a Yahoo,
and he who should eat his asparagus with a knife
and fork would have been classed with the traditional
collier who boiled his pineapple. Fish-knives
(like oxidized silver biscuit-boxes) were
unknown and undreamt-of horrors. To eat one's
fish with two forks was the <i>cachet</i> of a certain
circle, and the manner of manipulating the stones of
a cherry pie was the <i>articulus stantis vel cadentis</i>.
The little daughter of a great Whig house, whose
eating habits had been contracted in the nursery,
once asked her mother with wistful longing,
"Mamma, when shall I be old enough to eat
bread and cheese with a knife, and put the knife
in my mouth?" and she was promptly informed
that not if she lived to attain the age of Methuselah
would she be able to acquire that "unchartered
freedom." On the other hand, old gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of the very highest breeding used after dinner
to rinse their mouths in their finger-glasses, and
thereby caused unspeakable qualms in unaccustomed
guests. In that respect at any rate, if in
no other, the most inveterate praiser of times
past must admit that alteration has not been
deterioration.</p>

<p>Another marked change in society is the diminution
of stateliness. A really well-turned-out carriage,
with a coachman in a wig and two powdered footmen
behind, is as rare an object in the Mall as a
hansom in Bermondsey or a tandem in Bethnal
Green. Men go to the levée in cabs or on motor-cars,
and send their wives to the Palace Ball in the
products of the Coupé Company. The Dowager
Duchess of Cleveland (1792-1883) once told me
that Lord Salisbury had no carriage. On my expressing
innocent surprise, she said, "I have been
told that Lord Salisbury goes about London in a
brougham;" and her tone could not have expressed
a more lively horror if the vehicle had been a
coster's barrow. People of a less remote date than
the Duchess's had become inured to barouches for
ladies and broughams for men, but a landau was
contemned under the derogatory nickname of a
"demi-fortune," and the spectacle of a great man
scaling the dizzy heights of the 'bus or plunging
into the depths of the Twopenny Tube would have
given rise to lively comment.</p>

<p>A pillar of the Tory party, who died not twenty
years ago, finding his newly-married wife poking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the fire, took the poker from her hands and said
with majestic pain, "My dear, will you kindly remember
that you are now a countess?" A Liberal
statesman, still living, when he went to Harrow for
the first time, sailed up the Hill in the family coach,
and tradition does not report that his schoolfellows
kicked him with any special virulence.</p>

<p>I have known people who in travelling would
take the whole of a first-class carriage sooner
than risk the intrusion of an unknown fellow-passenger:
their descendants would as likely as
not reach their destination on motor-cars, having
pulled up at some wayside inn for mutton chops
and whisky-and-soda.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XLIII</h2>

<p class="pch">SOCIAL GRACES</p>

<p>Though stateliness has palpably diminished, the
beauty of life has as palpably increased. In old
days people loved, or professed to love, fine pictures,
and those who had them made much of
them. But with that one exception no one made
any attempt to surround himself with beautiful
objects. People who happened to have fine furniture
used it because they had it; unless, indeed,
the desire to keep pace with the fashion induced
them to part with Louis Seize or Chippendale and
replace it by the austere productions of Tottenham
Court Road. The idea of buying a chimneypiece
or a cabinet or a bureau because it was beautiful
never crossed the ordinary mind. The finest old
English china was habitually used, and not seldom
smashed, in the housekeeper's room. It was the
age of horse-hair and mahogany, and crimson flock
papers and green rep curtains. Whatever ornaments
the house happened to possess were clustered
together on a round table in the middle of the
drawing-room. The style has been immortalized
by the hand of a master: "There were no skilfully
contrasted shades of grey or green, no dado,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
no distemper. The woodwork was grained and
varnished after the manner of the Philistines, the
walls papered in dark crimson, with heavy curtains
of the same colour, and the sideboard, dinner-waggon,
and row of stiff chairs were all carved in
the same massive and expensive style of ugliness.
The pictures were those familiar presentments of
dirty rabbits, fat white horses, bloated goddesses,
and misshapen boors by masters, who if younger
than they assumed to be, must have been quite old
enough to know better." A man who hung a blue-and-white
plate on a wall, or put peacocks' feathers
in a vase, would have been regarded as insane;
and I well remember the outcry of indignation and
scorn when a well-known collector of bric-a-brac
had himself painted with a pet teapot in his hands.</p>

<p>In this respect the change is complete. The
owners of fine picture-galleries no longer monopolize
"art in the home." People who cannot
afford old masters invoke the genius of Mr. Mortimer
Menpes. If they have not inherited French
furniture they buy it, or at least imitations of the
real, which are quite as beautiful. A sage-green
wash on the wall, and a white dado to the height
of a man's shoulder, cover a multitude of paper-hanger's
sins. The commonest china is pretty in
form and colour. A couple of rugs from Liberty's
replace the hideous and costly carpets which lasted
their unfortunate possessors a lifetime; and, whereas
in those distant days one never saw a flower on
a dinner-table, now "it is roses, roses all the way,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
or, when it cannot be roses, it is daffodils and
tulips and poppies and chrysanthemums.</p>

<p>All this is the work of the despised æsthetes; but
this generation will probably see no meaning in
the great drama of "Patience," and has no conception
of the tyrannous ugliness from which Bunthorne
and his friends delivered us. Their double
achievement was to make ugliness culpable, and to
prove that beauty need not be expensive.</p>

<p>The same change may be observed in everything
connected with Dinner. No longer is the mind
oppressed by those monstrous hecatombs under
which, as Bret Harte said, "the table groaned and
even the sideboard sighed." Frascatelli's monstrous
bills of fare, with six "side dishes" and four
sweets, survive only as monuments of what our
fathers could do. Racing plate and "epergnes,"
with silver goddesses and sphinxes and rams' horns,
if not discreetly exchanged for prettier substitutes,
hide their diminished heads in pantries and safes.
Instead of these horrors, we have bright flowers
and shaded lights; and a very few, perhaps too few,
dishes, which both look pretty and taste good.
Here, again, expensive ugliness has been routed,
and inexpensive beauty enthroned in its place.</p>

<p>The same law, I believe, holds good about dress.
With the mysteries of woman's clothes I do not
presume to meddle. I do not attempt to estimate
the relative cost of the satins and ermine and
scarves which Lawrence painted, and the "duck's-egg
bolero" and "mauve hopsack" which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
lately seen advertized in the list of a winter sale.
But about men's dress I feel more confident. The
"rich cut Genoa velvet waistcoat," the solemn frock
coat, the satin stock, and the trousers strapped
under the wellingtons, were certainly hideous, and
I shrewdly suspect that they were vastly more
expensive than the blue serge suits, straw hats,
brown boots, and sailor-knot ties in which the men
of the present day contrive to look smart without
being stiff.</p>

<p>When Mr. Gladstone in old age revisited Oxford
and lectured on Homer to a great gathering of
undergraduates, he was asked if he saw any difference
between his hearers and the men of his
own time. He responded briskly, "Yes, in their
dress, an enormous difference. I am told that I had
among my audience some of the most highly-connected
and richest men in the university, and there
wasn't one whom I couldn't have dressed from top
to toe for £5."</p>

<p>I have spoken so far of material beauty, and here
the change in society has been an inexpressible improvement;
but, when I turn to beauty of another
kind, I cannot speak with equal certainty. Have
our manners improved? Beyond all question they
have changed, but have they changed for the
better?</p>

<p>It may seem incongruous to cite Dr. Pusey as an
authority on anything more mundane than a hair-shirt,
yet he was really a close observer of social
phenomena, as his famous sermon on Dives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Lazarus, with its strictures on the modern Dives's
dinner and Mrs. Dives's ball-gown, sufficiently
testifies. He was born a Bouverie in 1800, when
the Bouveries still were Whigs, and he testified in
old age to "the beauty of the refined worldly
manners of the old school," which, as he insisted,
were really Christian in their regard for the feelings
of others. "If in any case they became soulless as
apart from Christianity, the beautiful form was
there into which real life might re-enter."</p>

<p>We do not, I think, see much of the "beautiful
form" nowadays. Men when talking to women
lounge, and sprawl, and cross their legs, and keep
one hand in a pocket while they shake hands with
the other, and shove their partners about in the
"Washington Post," and wallow in the Kitchen-Lancers.
All this is as little beautiful as can be
conceived. Grace and dignity have perished side
by side. And yet, oddly enough, the people who
are most thoroughly bereft of manners seem bent
on displaying their deficiencies in the most conspicuous
places. In the old days it would have
been thought the very height of vulgarity to run
after royalty. The Duke of Wellington said to
Charles Greville, "When we meet the Royal Family
in society they are our superiors, and we owe them
all respect." That was just all. If a Royal Personage
knew you sufficiently well to pay you a visit, it
was an honour, and all suitable preparations were
made. "My father walked backwards with a silver
candlestick, and red baize awaited the royal feet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
If you encountered a prince or princess in society,
you made your bow and thought no more about it.
An old-fashioned father, who had taken a schoolboy
son to call on a great lady, said, "Your bow was
too low. That is the sort of bow we keep for the
Royal Family." There was neither drop-down-dead-ativeness,
nor pushfulness, nor familiarity.
Well-bred people knew how to behave themselves,
and there was an end of the matter. But to force
one's self on the notice of royalty, to intrigue for
visits from Illustrious Personages, to go out of one's
way to meet princes or princesses, to parade before
the gaping world the amount of intimacy with
which one had been honoured, would have been
regarded as the very madness of vulgarity.</p>

<p>Another respect in which modern manners compare
unfavourably with ancient is the growing love
of titles. In old days people thought a great deal,
perhaps too much, of Family. They had a strong
sense of territorial position, and I have heard
people say of others, "Oh, they are cousins of
ours," as if that fact put them within a sacred and
inviolable enclosure. But titles were contemned.
If you were a peer, you sate in the House of Lords
instead of the House of Commons; and that was all.
No one dreamed of babbling about "peers" as a
separate order of creation, still less of enumerating
the peers to whom they were related.</p>

<p>A member of the Tory Government was once
at pains to explain to an entirely unsympathetic
audience that the only reason why he and Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Curzon had not taken as good a degree as Mr.
Asquith was that, being the eldest sons of peers,
they were more freely invited into the County
society of Oxfordshire. I can safely say that, in the
sacred circle of the Great-Grandmotherhood, that
theory of academical shortcoming would not have
been advanced.</p>

<p>The idea of buying a baronetcy would have been
thought simply droll, and knighthood was regarded
as the guerdon of the successful grocer. I believe
that in their inmost hearts the Whigs enjoyed the
Garters which were so freely bestowed on them;
but they compounded for that human weakness by
unmeasured contempt for the Bath, and I doubt if
they had ever heard of the Star of India. To state
this case is sufficiently to illustrate a conspicuous
change in the sentiment of society.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XLIV</h2>

<p class="pch">PUBLICITY <i>V.</i> RETICENCE</p>

<p>The great people of old time followed (quite unconsciously)
the philosopher who bade man "hide
his life." Of course, the stage of politics was
always a pillory, and he who ventured to stand
on it made up his mind to encounter a vast
variety of popular missiles. "In my situation as
Chancellor of the University of Oxford," said the
Duke of Wellington, "I have been much exposed
to authors;" and men whom choice or circumstances
forced into politics were exposed to worse
annoyances than "authors." But the line was
rigidly drawn between public and private life.
What went on in the home was sacredly secreted
from the public gaze. People lived among their
relations and friends and political associates, and
kept the gaping world at a distance. Now we worship
Publicity as the chief enjoyment of human
life. We send lists of our shooting-parties to
"Society Journals." We welcome the Interviewer.
We contribute personal paragraphs to <i>Classy
Cuttings</i>. We admit the photographer to our bedrooms,
and give our portraits to illustrated papers.
We take our exercise when we have the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
chance of being seen and noticed, and we never
eat our dinner with such keen appetites as amid
the half-world of a Piccadilly restaurant. In brief,
"Expose thy life" is the motto of the new philosophy,
and I maintain that in this respect, at any
rate, the old was better.</p>

<p>With an increasing love of publicity has come
an increasing contempt for reticence. In old
days there were certain subjects which no one
mentioned; among them were Health and Money.
I presume that people had pretty much the same
complaints as now, but no one talked about them.
We used to be told of a lady who died in agony
because she insisted on telling the doctor that
the pain was in her chest whereas it really was
in the unmentionable organ of digestion. That
martyr to propriety has no imitators in the present
day. Every one has a disease and a doctor;
and young people of both sexes are ready on the
slightest acquaintance to describe symptoms and
compare experiences. "Ice!" exclaimed a pretty
girl at dessert, "good gracious, no! so bad for
indy"&mdash;and her companion, who had not travelled
with the times, learned with amazement that
"indy" was the pet name for indigestion. "How
bitterly cold!" said a plump matron at an open-air
luncheon; "just the thing to give one appendicitis."
"Oh!" said her neighbour, surveying
the company, "we are quite safe there. I shouldn't
think we had an appendix between us."</p>

<p>Then, again, as to money. In the "Sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Circle of the Great-Grandmotherhood" I never
heard the slightest reference to income. Not that
the Whigs despised money. They were at least as
fond of it as other people, and, even when it took
the shape of slum-rents, its odour was not displeasing.
But it was not a subject for conversation.
People did not chatter about their neighbours'
incomes; and, if they made their own money in
trades or professions, they did not regale us with
statistics of profit and loss. To-day every one
seems to be, if I may use the favourite colloquialism,
"on the make"; and the sincerity of
the devotion with which people worship money
pervades their whole conversation and colours
their whole view of life. "Scions of aristocracy,"
to use the good old phrase of Pennialinus, will
produce samples of tea or floor-cloth from their
pockets, and sue quite winningly for custom. A
speculative bottle of extraordinarily cheap peach-brandy
will arrive with the compliments of Lord
Tom Noddy, who has just gone into the wine
trade, and Lord Magnus Charters will tell you that,
if you are going to put in the electric light, his firm
has got some really good fittings which he can let
you have on specially easy terms.</p>

<p>But, if in old days Health and Money were subjects
eschewed in polite conversation, even more
rigid was the avoidance of "risky" topics. To-day
no scandal is too gross, no gossip too prurient.
Respectable mothers chatter quite freely about
that "nest of spicery" over which Sir Gorell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Barnes presides, and canvass abominations with a
self-possession worthy of Gibbon or Zola. In fact,
as regards our topics of conversation, we seem to
have reached the condition in which the Paris
correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> found himself
when Mr. Matthew Arnold (in "Friendship's
Garland") spoke to him of Delicacy. "He seemed
inexplicably struck by this word <i>delicacy</i>, which he
kept repeating to himself. 'Delicacy,' said he;
'delicacy, surely I have heard that word before!
Yes, in other days,' he went on dreamily, 'in my
fresh enthusiastic youth, before I knew Sala, before
I wrote for that infernal paper&mdash;&mdash;.' 'Collect
yourself, my friend,' said I, laying my hand on
his shoulder, 'you are unmanned.'" A similar
emotion would probably be caused by any one so
old-fashioned as to protest that any conceivable
topic was ill-adapted for discussion in general
society.</p>

<p>An extreme decorum of phrase accompanied
this salutary restriction of topics. To a boisterous
youth who, just setting out for a choral festival in
a country church, said that he always thought a
musical service very jolly, an old Whig lady said
in a tone of dignified amendment, "I trust, dear
Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, that we shall derive not only pleasure
but profit from the solemnity of this afternoon."</p>

<p>Closely related to the love of Publicity and the
decay of Reticence is the change in the position
of women. This is really a revolution, and it has
so impartially pervaded all departments of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
that one may plunge anywhere into the subject
and find the same phenomenon.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago the view that "comparisons
don't become a young woman" still held the field,
and, indeed, might have been much more widely
extended. Nothing "became a young woman,"
which involved clear thinking or plain speaking
or independent acting. Mrs. General and Mrs.
Grundy were still powers in the land. "Prunes
and Prism" were fair burlesques of actual shibboleths.
"Fanny," said Mrs. General, "at present
forms too many opinions. Perfect breeding forms
none, and is never demonstrative." This was
hardly a parody of the prevailing and accepted
doctrine. To-day it would be difficult to find a
subject on which contemporary Fannies do not
form opinions, and express them with intense
vigour, and translate them into corresponding
action.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago a hunting woman was a rarity,
even though Englishwomen had been horsewomen
from time immemorial. Lady Arabella Vane's performances
were still remembered in the neighbourhood
of Darlington, and Lady William Powlett's
"scyarlet" habit was a tradition at Cottesmore.
Mrs. Jack Villiers is the only horsewoman in the
famous picture of the Quorn, and she suitably
gave her name to the best covert in the Vale of
Aylesbury. But now the hunting woman and
the hunting girl pervade the land, cross their
male friends at their fences, and ride over them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
when they lie submerged in ditches, with an airy
cheerfulness which wins all hearts. In brief, it
may be said that, in respect of outdoor exercises,
whatever men and boys do women and girls do.
They drive four-in-hand and tandem, they manipulate
Motors, they skate and cycle, and fence and
swim. A young lady lately showed me a snapshot
of herself learning to take a header. A male
instructor, classically draped, stood on the bank,
and she kindly explained that "the head in the
water was the man we were staying with." Lawn-tennis
and croquet are regarded as the amusements
of the mild and the middle-aged; the
ardour of girlhood requires hockey and golf. I
am not sure whether girls have taken to Rugby
football, but only last summer I saw a girl's
cricket eleven dispose most satisfactorily of a
boy's team.</p>

<p>I can well remember the time when a man, if
perchance he met a lady while he was smoking in
some rather unfrequented street, flung his cigar
away and rather tried to look as if he had not
been doing it. Yet so far have we travelled that
not long ago, at a hospitable house not a hundred
miles from Berkeley Square, the hostess and her
daughter were the only smokers in a large luncheon-party,
and prefaced their cigarettes by the courteous
condition, "If you gentlemen don't mind."</p>

<p>Then, again, the political woman is a product
of these latter days. In old times a woman served
her husband's political party by keeping a <i>salon</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
giving dinners to the bigwigs, and "routs" to the
rank and file. I do not forget the heroic electioneering
of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire,
but her example was not widely followed. On great
occasions ladies sate in secluded galleries at public
meetings, and encouraged the halting rhetoric of
sons or husbands by waving pocket-handkerchiefs.
If a triumphant return was to be celebrated, the
ladies of the hero's family might gaze from above
on the congratulatory banquet, like the house-party
at Lothair's coming of age, to whom the
"three times three and one cheer more" seemed
like a "great naval battle, or the end of the
world, or anything else of unimaginable excitement,
tumult, and confusion."</p>

<p>When it was reported that a celebrated lady of
the present day complained of the stuffiness and
gloom of the Ladies' Gallery in the House of
Commons, Mr. Gladstone&mdash;that stiffest of social
conservatives&mdash;exclaimed, "Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;, forsooth!
I have known much greater ladies than Mrs.
W&mdash;&mdash; quite content to look down through the
ventilator."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">XLV</h2>

<p class="pch">TOWN <i>V.</i> COUNTRY</p>

<p>I said at the outset that I am a Whig <i>pur sang</i>;
and the historic Whigs were very worthy people. A
first-rate specimen of the race was that Duke of
Bedford whom Junius lampooned, and whom his
great-grandson, Lord John Russell, championed in
an interesting contrast. "The want of practical
religion and morals which Lord Chesterfield held
up to imitation, conducted the French nobility to
the guillotine and emigration: the honesty, the
attachment to religion, the country habits, the
love of home, the activity in rural business and
rural sports, in which the Duke of Bedford and
others of his class delighted, preserved the English
aristocracy from a flood which swept over
half of Europe, laying prostrate the highest of
her palaces, and scattering the ashes of the most
sacred of her monuments."</p>

<p>This quotation forms a suitable introduction to
the social change which is the subject of the
present chapter. In old days, people who had
country houses lived in them. It was the magnificent
misfortune of the Duke in "Lothair" to have
so many castles that he had no home. In those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
days the tradition of Duty required people who
had several country houses to spend some time
in each of them; and those who had only one
passed nine months out of twelve under its sacred
roof&mdash;sacred because it was inseparably connected
with memories of ancestry and parentage and early
association, with marriage and children, and pure
enjoyments and active benevolence and neighbourly
goodwill. In a word, the country house
was Home.</p>

<p>People who had no country house were honestly
pitied; perhaps they were also a little despised.
The most gorgeous mansion in Cromwell Road
or Tyburnia could never for a moment be quoted
as supplying the place of the Hall or the Manor.</p>

<p>For people who had a country house the interests
of life were very much bound up in the
park and the covers, the croquet-ground and
the cricket-ground, the kennel, the stable, and
the garden. I remember, when I was an undergraduate,
lionizing some Yorkshire damsels on
their first visit to Oxford, then in the "high midsummer
pomp" of its beauty. But all they said
was, in the pensive tone of an unwilling exile,
"How beautifully the sun must be shining on
the South Walk at home!"</p>

<p>The village church was a great centre of
domestic affection. All the family had been christened
in it. The eldest sister had been married
in it. Generations of ancestry mouldered under
the chancel floor. Christmas decorations were an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
occasion of much innocent merriment, and a little
ditty high in favour in Tractarian homes warned
the decorators to be&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Unselfish&mdash;looking not to see<br />
Proofs of their own dexterity;<br />
But quite contented that 'I' should<br />
Forgotten be in brotherhood."</p>

<p class="p1">Of course, whether Tractarian or Evangelical,
religious people regarded church-going as a spiritual
privilege; but every one recognized it as a
civil duty. "When a gentleman is <i>sur ses terres</i>,"
said Major Pendennis, "he must give an example
to the country people; and, if I could turn a
tune, I even think I should sing. The Duke of
St. David's, whom I have the honour of knowing,
always sings in the country, and let me tell you
it has a doosed fine effect from the family pew."
Before the passion for "restoration" had set in,
and ere yet Sir Gilbert Scott had transmogrified
the parish churches of England, the family pew
was indeed the ark and sanctuary of the territorial
system&mdash;and a very comfortable ark too.
It had a private entrance, a round table, a good
assortment of arm-chairs, a fireplace, and a wood-basket.
And I well remember a washleather glove
of unusual size which was kept in the wood-basket
for the greater convenience of making up
the fire during divine service. "You may restore
the church as much as you like," said an
old friend of my youth, who was lay-rector, to an
innovating incumbent, "but I must insist on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
family pew not being touched. If I had to sit in
an open seat, I should never get a wink of sleep
again."</p>

<p>A country home left its mark for all time on
those who were brought up in it. The sons
played cricket and went bat-fowling with the
village boys, and not seldom joined with them in
a poaching enterprise in the paternal preserves.
However popular or successful or happy a Public-School
boy might be at Eton or Harrow, he
counted the days till he could return to his pony
and his gun, his ferrets and rat-trap and fishing-rod.
Amid all the toil and worry of active life,
he looked back lovingly to the corner of the
cover where he shot his first pheasant, or the
precise spot in the middle of the Vale where
he first saw a fox killed, and underwent the disgusting
baptism of blood.</p>

<p>Girls, living more continuously at home, entered
even more intimately into the daily life of the
place. Their morning rides led them across the
village green; their afternoon drives were often
steered by the claims of this or that cottage to
a visit. They were taught as soon as they could
toddle never to enter a door without knocking,
never to sit down without being asked, and never
to call at meal-time.</p>

<p>They knew every one in the village&mdash;old and
young; played with the babies, taught the boys
in Sunday School, carried savoury messes to the
old and impotent, read by the sick-beds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
brought flowers for the coffin. Mamma knitted
comforters and dispensed warm clothing, organized
relief in hard winters and times of epidemic,
and found places for the hobbledehoys of both
sexes. The pony-boy and the scullery-maid were
pretty sure to be products of the village. Very
likely the young-ladies-maid was a village girl
whom the doctor had pronounced too delicate
for factory or farm. I have seen an excited
young groom staring his eyes out of his head
at the Eton and Harrow match, and exclaiming
with rapture at a good catch, "It was my young
governor as 'scouted' that. 'E's nimble, ain't 'e?"
And I well remember an ancient stable-helper at
a country house in Buckinghamshire who was
called "Old Bucks," because he had never slept
out of his native county, and very rarely out of
his native village, and had spent his whole life
in the service of one family.</p>

<p>Of course, when so much of the impressionable
part of life was lived amid the "sweet, sincere
surroundings of country life," there grew up,
between the family at the Hall and the families
in the village, a feeling which, in spite of our
national unsentimentality, had a chivalrous and
almost feudal tone. The interest of the poor in
the life and doings of "The Family" was keen and
genuine. The English peasant is too much a
gentleman to be a flatterer, and compliments
were often bestowed in very unexpected forms.
"They do tell me as 'is understanding's no worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
than it always were," was a ploughman's way of
saying that the old squire was in full possession
of his faculties. "We call 'im ''Is Lordship,'
because 'e's so old and so cunning," was another's
description of a famous pony. "Ah, I know
you're but a poor creature at the best!" was
the recognized way of complimenting a lady on
what she considered her bewitching and romantic
delicacy.</p>

<p>But these eccentricities were merely verbal, and
under them lay a deep vein of genuine and lasting
regard. "I've lived under four dukes and
four 'ousekeepers, and I'm not going to be put
upon in my old age!" was the exclamation of an
ancient poultry-woman, whose dignity had been
offended by some irregularity touching her Christmas
dinner. When the daughter of the house
married and went into a far country, she was sure
to find some emigrant from her old home who
welcomed her with effusion, and was full of enquiries
about his lordship and her ladyship, and
Miss Pinkerton the governess, and whether Mr.
Wheeler was still coachman, and who lived now at
the entrance-lodge. Whether the sons got commissions,
or took ranches, or become curates in
slums, or contested remote constituencies, some
grinning face was sure to emerge from the crowd
with, "You know me, sir? Bill Juffs, as used to
go bird's-nesting with you;" or, "You remember
my old dad, my lord? He used to shoe your black
pony."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>When the eldest son came of age, his condescension
in taking this step was hailed with
genuine enthusiasm. When he came into his kingdom,
there might be some grumbling if he went
in for small economies, or altered old practices,
or was a "hard man" on the Bench or at the
Board of Guardians; but, if he went on in the
good-natured old ways, the traditional loyalty
was unabated.</p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury wrote thus about the birth of
his eldest son's eldest son: "My little village is all
agog with the birth of a son and heir in the very
midst of them, the first, it is believed, since 1600,
when the first Lord Shaftesbury was born. The
christening yesterday was an ovation. Every
cottage had flags and flowers. We had three
triumphal arches; and all the people were exulting.
'He is one of us.' 'He is a fellow-villager.'
'We have now got a lord of our own.' This is
really gratifying. I did not think that there remained
so much of the old respect and affection
between peasant and proprietor, landlord and
tenant."</p>

<p>Whether the kind of relation thus described has
utterly perished I do not know; but certainly it
has very greatly diminished, and the cause of the
diminution is that people live less and less in their
country houses, and more and more in London.
For those who are compelled by odious necessity
to sell or let their hereditary homes one has nothing
but compassion; in itself a severe trial, it is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
still sharper to well-conditioned people by the
sense that the change is at least as painful to the
poor as to themselves. But for those who, having
both a country and a London house, deliberately
concentrate themselves on the town, forsake the
country, and abjure the duties which are inseparable
from their birthright, one can only feel
Charles Lamb's "imperfect sympathy." The
causes which induce this dereliction and its results
on society and on the country may be discussed
in another chapter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XLVI</h2>

<p class="pch">HOME</p>

<p>I was speaking just now of the growing tendency
to desert the country in favour of London. I said
that it was difficult to feel sympathy with people
who voluntarily abandon Home, and all the duties
and pleasures which Home implies, in favour of
Lennox Gardens or Portman Square; but that
one felt a lively compassion for those who make
the exchange under the pressure of&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear."</p>

<p class="p1">Here, again, is another social change. In old
days, when people wished to economize, it was
London that they deserted. They sold the "family
mansion" in Portland Place or Eaton Square;
and, if they revisited the glimpses of the social
moon, they took a furnished house for six weeks
in the summer: the rest of the year they spent
in the country. This plan was a manifold saving.
There was no rent to pay, and only very small
rates, for every one knows that country houses
were shamefully under-assessed. Carriages did
not require repainting every season, and no new
clothes were wanted. "What can it matter what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
we wear here, where every one knows who we
are?" The products of the park, the home farm,
the hothouses, and the kitchen-garden kept the
family supplied with food. A brother magnate
staying at Beaudesert with the famous Lord
Anglesey waxed enthusiastic over the mutton,
and said, "Excuse my asking you a plain question,
but how much does this excellent mutton
cost you?" "Cost me?" screamed the hero.
"Good Gad, it costs me nothing! It's my own,"
and he was beyond measure astonished when his
statistical guest proved that "his own" cost him
about a guinea per pound. In another great
house, conducted on strictly economical lines,
it was said that the very numerous family were
reared exclusively on rabbits and garden-stuff,
and that their enfeebled constitutions and dismal
appearance in later life were due to this ascetic
regimen.</p>

<p>People were always hospitable in the country,
but rural entertaining was not a very costly business.
The "three square meals and a snack,"
which represent the minimum requirement of the
present day, are a huge development of the system
which prevailed in my youth. Breakfast had
already grown from the tea and coffee, and rolls
and eggs, which Macaulay tells us were deemed
sufficient at Holland House, to an affair of covered
dishes. Luncheon-parties were sometimes given&mdash;terrible
ceremonies which lasted from two to
four; but the ordinary luncheon of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
was really a snack from the servants' joint or the
children's rice-pudding; and five o'clock tea was
actually not invented. To remember, as I do,
the foundress of that divine refreshment seems
like having known Stephenson or Jenner.</p>

<p>Dinner was substantial enough in all conscience,
and the wine nearly as heavy as the food.
Imagine quenching one's thirst with sherry in
the dog days! Yet so we did, till about half-way
through dinner, and then, on great occasions,
a dark-coloured rill of champagne began to trickle
into the saucer-shaped glasses. At the epoch of
cheese, port made its appearance in company with
home-brewed beer; and, as soon as the ladies
and the schoolboys departed, the men applied
themselves, with much seriousness of purpose,
to the consumption of claret which was really
vinous.</p>

<p>In this kind of hospitality there was no great
expense. People made very little difference between
their way of living when they were alone
and their way of living when they had company.
A visitor who wished to make himself agreeable
sometimes brought down a basket of fish or a
barrel of oysters from London; and, if one had
no deer of one's own, the arrival of a haunch
from a neighbour's or kinsman's park was the
signal for a gathering of local gastronomers.</p>

<p>And in matters other than meals life went on
very much the same whether you had friends
staying with you or whether you were alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Your guests drove and rode, and walked and
shot, according to their tastes and the season of
the year. They were carried off, more or less
willingly, to see the sights of the neighbourhood&mdash;ruined
castles, restored cathedrals, famous views.
In summer there might be a picnic or a croquet-party;
in winter a lawn-meet or a ball. But all
these entertainments were of the most homely
and inexpensive character. There was very little
outlay, no fuss, and no display. People, who
were compelled by stress of financial weather to
put into their country houses and remain there
till the storm was over, contrived to economize
and yet be comfortable. They simply lived their
ordinary lives until things righted themselves,
and very likely did not attempt London again
until they were bringing out another daughter,
or had to make a home for a son in the Guards.</p>

<p>But now an entirely different spirit prevails.
People seem to have lost the power of living
quietly and happily in their country homes. They
all have imbibed the urban philosophy of George
Warrington, who, when Pen gushed about the
country with its "long calm days, and long calm
evenings," brutally replied, "Devilish long, and
a great deal too calm. I've tried 'em." People
of that type desert the country simply because
they are bored by it. They feel with Mr. Luke
in "The New Republic," who, after talking about
"liberal air," "sedged brooks," and "meadow
grass," admitted that it would be a horrid bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
to have no other society than the clergyman
of the parish, and no other topics of conversation
than Justification by Faith and the measles.
They do not care for the country in itself;
they have no eye for its beauty, no sense of
its atmosphere, no memory for its traditions.
It is only made endurable to them by sport
and gambling and boisterous house-parties; and,
when from one cause or another these resources
fail, they are frankly bored and long for London.
They are no longer content, as our fathers were,
to entertain their friends with hospitable simplicity.
So profoundly has all society been
vulgarized by the worship of the Golden Calf
that, unless people can vie with alien millionaires
in the sumptuousness with which they "do
you"&mdash;delightful phrase,&mdash;they prefer not to entertain
at all. An emulous ostentation has killed
hospitality.</p>

<p>So now, when a season of financial pressure
sets in, people shut up their country houses, let
their shooting, cut themselves off with a sigh of
relief from all the unexciting duties and simple
pleasures of the Home, and take refuge from
boredom in the delights of London. In London
life has no duties. Little is expected of one,
and nothing required. One can live on a larger
or a smaller scale according to one's taste or
one's purse; cramp oneself in a doll's house
in Mayfair, or expand one's wings in a Kensingtonian
mansion; or even contract oneself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
a flat, or hide one's diminished head in the
upper storey of a shop. One can entertain or
not entertain, spend much or spend little, live
on one's friends or be lived on by them, exactly
as one finds most convenient: and unquestionably
social freedom is a great element in human
happiness.</p>

<p>For many natures London has an attractiveness
which is all its own, and yet to indulge one's taste
for it may be a grave dereliction of duty. The
State is built upon the Home; and, as a training-place
for social virtue, there can surely be no
comparison between a home in the country and a
home in London.</p>

<p>"Home! Sweet Home!" Yes. (I am quoting
now from my friend, Henry Scott Holland.) That
is the song that goes straight to the heart of every
English man and woman. For forty years we
have never asked Madame Adelina Patti to sing
anything else. The unhappy, decadent, Latin races
have not even a word in their languages by which
to express it, poor things! Home is the secret of
our honest British Protestant virtues. It is the
only nursery of our Anglo-Saxon citizenship.
Back to it our far-flung children turn with all their
memories aflame. They may lapse into rough
ways, but they keep something sound at the core so
long as they are faithful to the old Home. There
is still a tenderness in the voice, and tears are in
their eyes, as they speak together of the days that
can never die out of their lives, when they were at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
home in the old familiar places, with father and
mother in the healthy gladness of their childhood.
Ah!</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"Home! Sweet Home!<br />
There's no place like Home."</p>

<p class="p1">That is what we all repeat, and all believe, and
cheer to the echo. And, behind all our British
complacency about it, nobody would deny the vital
truth that there is in this belief of ours. Whatever
tends to make the Home beautiful, attractive,
romantic&mdash;to associate it with the ideas of pure
pleasure and high duty&mdash;to connect it not only with
all that was happiest but also with all that was
best in early years&mdash;whatever fulfils these purposes
purifies the fountains of national life. A home, to
be perfectly a home, should "incorporate tradition,
and prolong the reign of the dead." It should
animate those who dwell in it to virtue and beneficence
by reminding them of what others did, who
went before them in the same place and lived amid
the same surroundings.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">XLVII</h2>

<p class="pch">HOSPITALITY</p>

<p>In my last chapter I was deploring the modern
tendency of society to desert the country and cultivate
London. And the reason why I deplore it is
that all the educating influences of the Home are so
infinitely weaker in the town than in the country.
In a London home there is nothing to fascinate
the eye. The contemplation of the mews and the
chimney-pots through the back windows of the
nursery will not elevate even the most impressible
child. There is no mystery, no dreamland, no
Enchanted Palace, no Bluebeard's Chamber, in a
stucco mansion built by Cubitt or a palace of terracotta
on the Cadogan estate. There can be no
traditions of the past, no inspiring memories of
virtuous ancestry, in a house which your father
bought five years ago and of which the previous
owners are not known to you even by name.
"The Square" or "the Gardens" are sorry substitutes
for the Park and the Pleasure-grounds,
the Common and the Downs. Crossing-sweepers
are a deserving folk, but you cannot cultivate
those intimate relations with them which bind
you to the lodge-keeper at home, or to the old
women in the almshouses, or the octogenarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
waggoner who has driven your father's team
ever since he was ten years old. St. Peter's,
Eaton Square, or All Saints, Margaret Street,
may be beautifully ornate, and the congregation
what Lord Beaconsfield called "brisk and
modish"; but they can never have the romantic
charm of the country church where you were
confirmed side by side with the keeper's son, or
proposed to the vicar's daughter when you were
wreathing holly round the lectern.</p>

<p>Then, again, as regards social relations with
friends and neighbours. "An emulous ostentation
has destroyed hospitality." This I believe is
absolutely true, and it is one of the worst changes
which I have seen. I have already spoken of
hospitality as practised in the country. Now I
will say a word about hospitality in London.</p>

<p>Of course rich people always gave banquets
from time to time, and these were occasions when,
in Lord Beaconsfield's drolly vulgar phrase, "the
dinner was stately, as befits the high nobility."
They were ceremonious observances, conducted
on the constitutional principle of "cutlet for
cutlet," and must always have been regarded by
all concerned in them, whether as hosts or guests,
in the light of duty rather than of pleasure.
Twenty people woke that morning with the impression
that something was to be gone through
before bedtime, which they would be glad enough
to escape. Each of the twenty went to bed that
night more or less weary and ruffled, but sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
by the sense that a social duty had been
performed. Banquets, however, at the worst were
only periodical events. Real hospitality was constant
and informal.</p>

<p>"Come and dine to-night. Eight o'clock. Pot
luck. Don't dress."</p>

<p>"My dear, I am going to bring back two or
three men from the House. Don't put off dinner
in case we are kept by a division."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must be going back. I am only
paired till eleven. Good-night, and so many thanks."</p>

<p>"Good-night; you will always find some dinner
here on Government nights. Do look in again!"</p>

<p>These are the cheerful echoes of parliamentary
homes in the older and better days of unostentatious
entertaining, and those "pot luck"
dinners often played an important part in political
man&oelig;uvre. Sir George Trevelyan, whose early
manhood was passed in the thick of parliamentary
society, tells us, in a footnote to "The Ladies in
Parliament," that in the season of 1866 there was
much gossip over the fact of Lord Russell having
entertained Mr. Bright at dinner, and that people
were constantly&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">
"Discussing whether Bright can scan and understand the lines<br />
About the Wooden Horse of Troy; and when and where he dines.<br />
Though gentlemen should blush to talk as if they cared a button<br />
Because one night in Chesham Place he ate his slice of mutton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Quite apart from parliamentary strategy, impromptu
entertaining in what was called "a
friendly way" had its special uses in the social
system. There is a delicious passage in "Lothair"
describing that hero's initiation into an easier and
more graceful society than that in which he had
been reared: "He had been a guest at the occasional
banquets of his uncle, but these were
festivals of the Picts and Scots; rude plenty and
coarse splendour, with noise instead of conversation,
and a tumult of obstructive dependants,
who impeded by their want of skill the very convenience
which they were purposed to facilitate."
An amazing sentence indeed, but like all Lord
Beaconsfield's writings, picturesquely descriptive,
and happily contrasted with the succeeding scene:
"A table covered with flowers, bright with fanciful
crystal, and porcelain that had belonged to
Sovereigns who had given a name to its colour
or its form. As for those present, all seemed
grace and gentleness, from the radiant daughters
of the house to the noiseless attendants who anticipated
all his wants, and sometimes seemed to
suggest his wishes."</p>

<p>The mention of "Lothair" reminds people of
my date that thirty years ago we knew a house
justly famed for the excellent marriages which
the daughters made. There banquets were unknown,
and even dinners by invitation very rare.
The father used to collect young men from
Lord's, or the Lobby, or the Club, or wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
he had been spending the afternoon. Servants
were soon dismissed&mdash;"It is such a bore to have
them staring at one"&mdash;and the daughters of the
house waited on the guests. Here obviously were
matrimonial openings not to be despised; and,
even in families where there were no ulterior
objects to be served, these free-and-easy entertainings
went on from February to July. Short
invitations, pleasant company, and genuine friendliness
were the characteristics of these gatherings.
Very often the dinner was carved on the
table. One could ask for a second slice or another
wing without feeling greedy, and the claret and
amontillado were within the reach of every guest.
This, I consider, was genuine hospitality, for it
was natural, easy, and unostentatious.</p>

<p>But now, according to all accounts, the spirit of
entertaining is utterly changed. A dinner is not
so much an opportunity of pleasing your friends as
of airing your own magnificence; and ostentation,
despicable in itself, is doubly odious because it is
emulous. If A has a good cook, B must have a
better. If C gave you ortolans stuffed with truffles,
D must have truffles stuffed with ortolans. If the
E's table is piled with strawberries in April, the F's
must retaliate with orchids at a guinea a blossom.
G is a little inclined to swagger about his wife's
pearl necklace, and H is bound in honour to
decorate Mrs. H with a <i>rivière</i> which belonged to
the crown jewels of France.</p>

<p>And, as with the food and the decorations, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
also with the company. Here, again, Emulous
Ostentation carries all before it. Mr. Goldbug is a
Yahoo, but he made his millions in South Africa
and spends them in Park Lane. Lord Heath is
the most abandoned bore in Christendom, but he
is an authority at Newmarket. Lady Bellair has
had a notoriously chequered career, but she plays
bridge in exalted circles. As Lord Crewe sings of
a similar enchantress&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"From reflections we shrink;<br />
And of comment are chary;</p>
<p class="pin4">But her face is <i>so</i> pink,<br />
And it don't seem to vary."</p>

<p class="p1">However, she is unquestionably smart; and
Goldbug is a useful man to know; and we are not
going to be outdone by the Cashingtons, who got
Heath to dine with them twice last year. So we
invite our guests, not because we like them or
admire them, for that in these cases is impossible;
not&mdash;heaven knows&mdash;because they are beautiful or
famous or witty; but because they are the right
people to have in one's house, and we will have the
right people or perish in the attempt.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XLVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">OSTENTATION</p>

<p>It is many a long year since I saw the inside of a
ballroom, but by all accounts very much the same
change has come over the spirit of ball-giving as of
dinner-giving. Here again the "Emulous Ostentation"
which I have described is the enemy. When
I first grew up, there were infinitely more balls
than now. From Easter till August there were
at least two every night, and a hostess counted
herself lucky if she had only one rival to contend
with. Between 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Grosvenor
Place was blocked by the opposing streams of
carriages going from Mayfair to Belgravia, and
from Belgravia to Mayfair. There were three or
four really great Houses&mdash;"Houses" with a capital
H&mdash;such as Grosvenor House, Stafford House,
Dudley House, and Montagu House&mdash;where a
ball could scarcely help being an event&mdash;or, as
Pennialinus would say, "a function." But, putting
these on one side, the great mass of hostesses
contrived to give excellent balls, where every
one went and every one enjoyed themselves,
with very little fuss and no ostentation. The
drawing-room of an ordinary house in Belgravia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
or Grosvenor Square made a perfectly sufficient
ballroom. A good floor, a good band, and plenty
of light, were the only essentials of success.
Decoration was represented by such quaint devices
as pink muslin on the banisters, or green
festoons dependent from the chandelier. A good
supper was an additional merit; and, if the host
produced his best champagne, he was held in
just esteem by dancing men. But yet I well
remember a cold supper at a ball which the present
King and Queen attended, in 1881, and no
one grumbled, though perhaps the young bloods
thought it a little old-fashioned. The essence
of a good ball was not expense or display
or overwhelming preparation, but the certainty
that you would meet your friends. Boys and
girls danced, and married women looked on, or
only stole a waltz when their juniors were at
supper. In those days a ball was really a
merry-making.</p>

<p>Nowadays I gather from the <i>Morning Post</i> that
balls are comparatively rare events, but what they
lack in frequency they make up in ostentation.
As to the sums which the Heits and the Heims,
the Le Beers and the De Porters, lavish on one
night's entertainment I hear statistical accounts
which not only outrage economy but stagger
credibility. Here again the rushing flood of ill-gotten
gold has overflowed its banks, and polluted
the "crystal river of unreproved enjoyment."</p>

<p>There is yet another form of entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
which Emulous Ostentation has destroyed. A
few years ago there still were women in London
who could hold a "salon." Of these gatherings
the principal attraction was the hostess, and, in
a secondary degree, the agreeableness of the
people whom she could gather round her. Of
fuss and finery, decoration and display, there
was absolutely nothing. A typical instance of
what I mean will perhaps recur to the memory
of some who read this chapter. Picture to yourself
two not very large and rather dingy rooms. The
furniture is dark and old-fashioned&mdash;mahogany
and rosewood, with here and there a good cabinet
or a French armchair. No prettiness of lace and
china; no flowers; and not very much light.
Books everywhere, some good engravings, a
comfortable sofa, and a tray of tea and coffee.
That was all. It is difficult to conceive a less
ostentatious or a more economical mode of entertaining;
yet the lady who presided over that
"salon" had been for fifty years one of the most
celebrated women in Europe; had been embraced
by Napoleon; had flirted with the Allied
Sovereigns; had been described by Byron; had
discussed scholarship with Grote, and statecraft
with Metternich; had sate to Lawrence, and
caballed with Antonelli. Even in old age and
decrepitude she opened her rooms to her friends
every evening in the year, and never, even in
the depths of September, found her court deserted.
Certainly it was a social triumph, and one has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
only to compare it with the scene in the stockbroker's
saloon&mdash;the blaze of electric light, the
jungle of flowers, the furniture from Sinclair's,
the pictures from Christie's&mdash;and to contrast the
assembled guests. Instead of celebrities, notorieties&mdash;woman
at once under-dressed and over-dressed;
men with cent. per cent. written deep
in every line of their expressive countenances;
and, at the centre of the throng, a hostess in a
diamond crown, who conducts her correspondence
by telegraph, because her spelling is a
little shaky and mistakes in telegrams are charitably
attributed to the clerks.</p>

<p>One of the worst properties of Emulous Ostentation
is that it naturally affects its victims with
an insatiable thirst for money. If Mrs. Tymmyns
in Onslow Gardens is to have as good a dinner,
and as smart a victoria, and as large a tiara, as
her friend Mrs. Goldbug in Park Lane, it is
obvious that Mr. Tymmyns must find the money
somehow. Who wills the end wills the means;
and, if social exigencies demand a larger outlay,
the Tymmynses cannot afford to be too scrupulous
about their method of providing for it. I
suppose it is this consideration which makes us
just now a nation of gamblers, whereas our
more respectable but less adventurous fathers were
well content to be a nation of shopkeepers.</p>

<p>Of course, in all ages there has been a gambling
clique in society; but in old days it kept itself,
as the saying is, to itself. Of necessity it always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
was on the look-out for neophytes to initiate
and to pillage, but the non-gambling majority
of society regarded the gambling minority with
horror; and a man who palpably meant to
make money out of a visit to a country house
would probably have been requested to withdraw.
"Order a fly for Mr. L. at eleven o'clock,"
said old Lord Crewe to the butler when a guest
had committed a social atrocity under his roof.
"Thank you, Lord Crewe," said Mr. L., "but not
for me. I am not going to-day." "Oh yes, you
are," responded the host, and secreted himself in
his private apartments till the offender had been
duly extruded. Similar justice would, I think,
have been dealt out to a gambler who rooked
the young and the inexperienced. Not so to-day;
the pigeon, however unfledged and tender, is
the appointed prey of the rook, and the venerable
bird who does the plucking is entirely undeterred
by any considerations of pity, shame, or fear. "Is
he any good?" is a question which circulates round
the Board of Green Cloth whenever a new face fresh
from Oxford or Sandhurst is noted in the social
throng. "Oh yes, he's all right; I know his people,"
may be the cheerful response; or else, in a very
different note, "No, he hasn't got a feather to fly
with." Fortunate is the youth on whom this disparaging
verdict is pronounced, for in that case he
may escape the benevolent attentions of the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But even impecuniosity does not always protect
the inexperienced. A lady who had lived for
some years in the country returned to London
not long ago, and, enumerating the social changes
which she had observed, she said, "People seem
to marry on £500 a year and yet have diamond
tiaras." It was, perhaps, a too hasty generalization,
but an instance in point immediately recurred to
my recollection. A young couple had married
with no other means of subsistence than smartness,
good looks, and pleasant manners. After a
prolonged tour round the country houses of their
innumerable friends, they settled down at Woolwich.
"Why Woolwich?" was the natural enquiry;
and the reason, when at length it came
to light, was highly characteristic of the age. It
appeared that these kind young people used to
give nice little evening parties, invite the "Gentlemen
Cadets" from Woolwich Academy, and make
them play cards for money. The device of setting
up housekeeping on the pocket-money of
babes and sucklings is thoroughly symptomatic
of our decadence. Emulous Ostentation makes
every one want more money than he has, and at
the same time drugs all scruples of conscience
as to the method of obtaining it.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XLIX</h2>

<p class="pch">PRINCIPLE AND PREJUDICE</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Froude once told me that he did not
in the least mind the accusation which was brought
against him (certainly not without reason) of being
prejudiced. "A good stiff prejudice," he said,
"is a very useful thing. It is like a rusty weathercock.
It will yield to a strong and long-continued
blast of conviction, but it does not veer round
and round in compliance with every shifting
current of opinion."</p>

<p>What Mr. Froude expressed other people felt,
though perhaps they would not have cared to
avow it so honestly.</p>

<p>One of the most notable changes which I have
seen is the decay of prejudice. In old days
people felt strongly and spoke strongly, and acted
as they spoke. In every controversy they were
absolutely certain that they were right and that
the other side was wrong, and they did not mince
their words when they expressed their opinions.</p>

<p>The first Lord Leicester of the present creation
(1775-1844) told my father (1807-1894) that, when
he was a boy, his grandfather had taken him on
his knee and said, "Now, my dear Tom, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
else you do in life, mind you never trust a
Tory;" and Lord Leicester added, "I never have,
and, by George, I never will." On the other
hand, when Dr. Longley, afterwards Archbishop
of Canterbury, did homage on his appointment to
the see of Ripon, King William IV. said, "Bishop
of Ripon, I charge you, as you shall answer
before Almighty God, that you never by word or
deed give encouragement to those d&mdash;&mdash; d Whigs,
who would upset the Church of England."</p>

<p>John Keble, the gentle saint of the Tractarian
movement, when he saw the Whigs preparing to
attack the property of the Church, proclaimed
that the time had come when "scoundrels should
be called scoundrels." And the Tractarians had
no monopoly of vigorous invective, for, when
their famous "Tract XC." incurred the censure of
an Evangelical dean, he urbanely remarked that
"he would be sorry to trust the author of that
tract with his purse."</p>

<p>Macaulay, on the morning after a vital division,
in which the Whigs had saved their places by
seventy-nine votes, wrote triumphantly to his
sister&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">"So hang the dirty Tories, and let them starve and pine,<br />
And hurrah! for the majority of glorious seventy-nine."</p>

<p class="p1">The same cordial partisan wrote of a political
opponent that he was "a bad, a very bad, man;
a disgrace to politics and to literature;" and,
of an acquaintance who had offended him socially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
"his powers gone; his spite immortal&mdash;a dead
nettle."</p>

<p>The great and good Lord Shaftesbury, repudiating
the theology of "Ecce Homo," pronounced it
"the most pestilential book ever vomited from
the jaws of Hell;" and, dividing his political
favours with admirable impartiality, he denounced
"the brazen faces, low insults, and accursed
effrontery" of the Radicals; declared that Mr.
Gladstone's "public life had long been an effort
to retain his principles and yet not lose his
position;" and dismissed Lord Beaconsfield as "a
leper, without principle, without feeling, without
regard to anything, human or divine, beyond his
personal ambition." In the same spirit of hearty
prejudice, Bishop Wilberforce deplored the political
exigencies which had driven his friend Gladstone
into "the foul arms of the Whigs." In
the opposite camp was ranged a lady, well remembered
in the inner circles of Whiggery, who
never would enter a four-wheeled cab until she
had elicited from the driver that he <i>was not</i> a
Puseyite and <i>was</i> a Whig.</p>

<p>"Mamma," asked a little girl of Whig parentage,
who from her cradle had heard nothing but
denunciation of her father's political opponents,
"are Tories born wicked, or do they grow
wicked afterwards?" And her mother judiciously
replied, "My dear, they are born wicked and
grow worse."</p>

<p>But alas! they are "gone down to Hades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
even many stalwart sons of heroes,"&mdash;with King
William at their head, and Lord Shaftesbury and
Lord Leicester, and Keble and Macaulay and
Froude in his wake&mdash;men who knew what they
believed, and, knowing it, were not ashamed to
avow it, and saw little to praise or like in the
adherents of a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>They are gone, and we are left&mdash;an unprejudiced,
but an invertebrate and a flaccid, generation.
No one seems to believe anything very firmly.
No one has the slightest notion of putting himself
to any inconvenience for his belief. No one
dreams of disliking or distrusting a political or
religious opponent, or of treating difference of
opinion as a line of social cleavage.</p>

<p>In old days, King Leopold of Belgium told
Bishop Wilberforce that "the only position for
a Church was to say, 'Believe this or you are
damned.'" To-day nothing in religion is regarded
as unquestionably true. When the late
Archbishop Benson first became acquainted with
society in London, he asked, in shocked amazement,
"What do these people believe?"&mdash;and
no very satisfactory answer was forthcoming.
If society has any religious beliefs (and this is
more than questionable), it holds them with the
loosest grasp, and is on the easiest terms of
intercourse with every other belief and unbelief.
The most fashionable teachers of religion have
one eye nervously fixed on the ever-shifting
currents of negation, talk plausibly about putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the Faith in its proper relation with modern
thought, and toil panting in the wake of science;
only to find each fresh theory exploded just at
the moment when they have managed to apprehend
it.</p>

<p>We used to be taught in our nurseries that, when
"Old Daddy Longlegs wouldn't say his prayers," it
was our duty to "Take him by the left leg and
throw him downstairs;" and the student of folklore
will be pleased to observe in this ditty the immemorial
inclination of mankind to punish people
who will not square their religion with ours. The
spirit of religious persecution dies hard, but the
decay of prejudice has sapped its strength. It does
not thrive in the atmosphere of modern indifferentism,
and admirable ladies who believe that Ritualists
ride donkeys on Palm Sunday and sacrifice
lambs on Good Friday find it difficult to revive
the cry of "No Popery" with any practical effect.</p>

<p>The decay of prejudice in the sphere of politics
is even more remarkable than in that of religion.
In old days, political agreement was a strong and
a constraining bond. When people saw a clear
right and wrong in politics, they governed their
private as well as their public life accordingly.
People who held the same political beliefs lived
and died together. In society and hospitality, in
work and recreation, in journalism and literature&mdash;even
in such seemingly indifferent matters as art
and the drama&mdash;they were closely and permanently
associated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Eton was supposed to cherish a romantic affection
for the Stuarts, and therefore to be a fit training
place for sucking Tories; Harrow had always
been Hanoverian, and therefore attracted little
Whigs to its Hill. Oxford, with its Caroline theology
and Jacobite tradition, was the Tory university;
Cambridge was the nursing-mother of Whigs,
until Edinburgh, under the influence of Jeffrey and
Brougham, tore her babes from her breast. In
society you must choose between the Duchess
of Devonshire and the Duchess of Gordon, or,
in a later generation, between Lady Holland and
Lady Jersey. In clubland the width of St. James's
Street marked a dividing line of abysmal depth;
and to this day "Grillon's" remains the memorial
of an attempt, then unique, to bring politicians of
opposite sides together in social intercourse. On
the one side stood Scott&mdash;where Burke had stood
before him&mdash;the Guardian Angel of Monarchy
and Aristocracy: on the other were Shelley and
Byron, and (till they turned their coats) the emancipated
singers of Freedom and Humanity. The
two political parties had even their favourite actors,
and the Tories swore by Kemble while the Whigs
roared for Kean.</p>

<p>Then, as now, the Tories were a wealthy,
powerful, and highly-organized confederacy. The
Whigs were notoriously a family party. From
John, Lord Gower, who died in 1754, and was
the great-great-great-grandfather of the present
Duke of Sutherland, descend all the Gowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Levesons, Howards, Cavendishes, Grosvenors, Harcourts,
and Russells who walk on the face of
the earth. It is a goodly company. Well might
Thackeray exclaim, "I'm not a Whig; but oh,
how I should like to be one!"</p>

<p>Lord Beaconsfield described in "Coningsby"
how the Radical manufacturer, sending his boy to
Eton, charged him to form no intimacies with his
father's hereditary foes. This may have been a
flight of fancy; but certainly, when a lad was
going to Oxford or Cambridge, his parents and
family friends would warn him against entering
into friendships with the other side. The University
Clubs which he joined and the votes which
he gave at the Union were watched with anxious
care. He was early initiated into the political
society to which his father belonged. Extraneous
intimacies were regarded with the most suspicious
anxiety. Mothers did all they knew to make their
darlings acquainted with daughters of families
whose political faith was pure, and I have myself
learned, by not remote tradition, the indignant
horror which pervaded a great Whig family when
the heir-presumptive to its honours married the
daughter of a Tory Lord Chamberlain. "That
girl will ruin the politics of the family and undo
the work of two hundred years" was the prophecy;
and I have seen it fulfilled.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p2">L</h2>

<p class="pch">CULTURE</p>

<p>One of the social changes which most impresses
me is the decay of intellectual cultivation. This
may sound paradoxical in an age which habitually
talks so much about Education and Culture; but
I am persuaded that it is true. Dilettantism is
universal, and a smattering of erudition, infinitely
more offensive than honest and manly ignorance,
has usurped the place which was formerly occupied
by genuine and liberal learning. My own
view of the subject is probably tinged by the fact
that I was born a Whig and brought up in a
Whiggish society; for the Whigs were rather
specially the allies of learning, and made it a point
of honour to know, though never to parade, the
best that has been thought and written. Very
likely they had no monopoly of culture, and the
Tories were just as well-informed. But a man
"belongs to his belongings," and one can only
describe what one has seen; and here the contrast
between Past and Present is palpable enough. I
am not now thinking of professed scholars and
students, such as Lord Stanhope and Sir Charles
Bunbury, or of professed blue-stockings, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Barbarina Lady Dacre and Georgiana Lady Chatterton;
but of ordinary men and women of good
family and good position, who had received the
usual education of their class and had profited
by it.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone used to say that, in his schooldays
at Eton, it was possible to learn much or
to learn nothing, but it was not possible to learn
superficially. And one saw the same in afterlife.
What people professed to know they knew.
The affectation of culture was despised; and
ignorance, where it existed, was honestly confessed.
For example, every one knew Italian,
but no one pretended to know German. I remember
men who had never been to a University
but had passed straight from a Public
School to a Cavalry Regiment or the House of
Commons, and who yet could quote Horace as
easily as the present generation quotes Kipling.
These people inherited the traditions of Mrs.
Montagu, who "vindicated the genius of Shakespeare
against the calumnies of Voltaire," and
they knew the greatest poet of all time with an
absolute ease and familiarity. They did not
trouble themselves about various readings and
corrupt texts and difficult passages. They had
nothing in common with that true father of all
Shakespearean criticism, Mr. Curdle in "Nicholas
Nickleby," who had written a treatise on the
question whether Juliet's nurse's husband was
really "a merry man" or whether it was merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
his widow's affectionate partiality that induced
her so to report him. But they knew the whole
mass of the plays with a wide and generous
intimacy; their speech was saturated with the
immortal diction, and Hamlet's speculations were
their nearest approach to metaphysics.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, all educated people knew the
English poets down to the end of the eighteenth
century. Byron and Moore were enjoyed with a
sort of furtive and fearful pleasure; and Wordsworth
was tolerated. Every one knew Scott's
novels by heart, and had his or her favourite
heroine and hero.</p>

<p>Then, again, all educated people knew history
in a broad and comprehensive way. They did not
concern themselves about ethnological theories,
influences of race and climate and geography,
streams of tendency, and the operation of unseen
laws; but they knew all about the great
people and the great events of time. They were
conversant with all that was concrete and ascertainable;
and they took sides as eagerly and as
definitely in the strifes of Yorkist and Lancastrian,
Protestant and Papist, Roundhead and
Cavalier, as in the controversies over the Reform
Bill or the Repeal of the Corn Laws.</p>

<p>Then, again, all educated people knew the laws
of architecture and of painting; and, though
it must be confessed that in these respects
their views were not very original, still they
were founded on first-hand knowledge of famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
models, and, though conventional, were never
ignorant.</p>

<p>But it will be said that all this represents no
very overwhelming mass of culture, and that, if
these were all the accomplishments which the
last generation had to boast of, their successors
have no reason to dread comparison.</p>

<p>Well, I expressly said that I was not describing
learned or even exceptionally well-read people, but
merely the general level of educated society; and
that level is, I am persuaded, infinitely lower than
it was in former generations. Of course there are
instances to the contrary which perplex and
disturb the public judgment, and give rise to
the delusion that this is a learned age. Thus we
have in society and politics such scholars as Lord
Milner and Mr. Asquith and Mr. Herbert Paul; but
then there have always been some scholars in
public life, so there is nothing remarkable in the
persistence of the type; whereas, on the other
hand, the system of smattering and top-dressing
which pervades Universities and Public Schools
produces an ever-increasing crop of gentlemen
who, like Mr. Riley in "The Mill on the Floss,"
have brought away with them from Oxford or
Cambridge a general sense of knowing Latin,
though their comprehension of any particular
Latin is not ready.</p>

<p>It is, I believe, generally admitted that we speak
French less fluently and less idiomatically than
our fathers. The "barbarous neglect" of Italian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
which used to rouse Mr. Gladstone's indignation,
is now complete; and an even superstitious respect
for the German language is accompanied
by a curious ignorance of German literature. I
remember an excellent picture in <i>Punch</i> which
depicted that ideal representative of skin-deep
culture&mdash;the Rev. Robert Elsmere&mdash;on his knees
before the sceptical squire, saying, "Pray, pray,
don't mention the name of another German writer,
or I shall have to resign my living."</p>

<p>Then, again, as regards women; of whom, quite
as much as of men, I was thinking when I described
the culture of bygone society. Here and
there we see startling instances of erudition which
throw a reflected and undeserved glory upon the
undistinguished average. Thus we have seen a
lady Senior Wrangler and a lady Senior Classic,
and I myself have the honour of knowing a sweet
girl-graduate with golden hair, who got two Firsts
at Oxford.</p>

<p>The face of the earth is covered with Girls'
High Schools, and Women's Colleges standing
where they ought not. I am told, but do not
know, that girl-undergraduates are permitted to
witness physiological experiments in the torture-dens
of science; and a complete emancipation
in the matter of reading has introduced women
to regions of thought and feeling which in old
days were the peculiar domain of men. The
results are not far to seek.</p>

<p>One lady boldly takes the field with an assault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
on Christianity, and her apparatus of belated
criticism and second-hand learning sets all society
agape. Another fills a novel with morbid pathology,
slays the villain by heart-disease, or makes
the heroine interesting with phthisis; and people,
forgetting Mr. Casaubon and Clifford Gray, exclaim,
"How marvellous! This is, indeed, original
research." A third, a fourth, and a fifth devote
themselves to the task of readjusting the relation
of the sexes, and fill their passionate volumes
with seduction and lubricity. And here, again,
just because our mothers did not traffic in these
wares, the undiscerning public thinks that it has
discovered a new vein of real though unsavoury
learning, and ladies say, "It is not exactly a
pleasant book, but one cannot help admiring the
power."</p>

<p>Now I submit that these abnormalities are no
substitute for decent and reasonable culture.
Pedantry is not learning; and a vast deal of
specialism, "mugged-up," as boys say, at the
British Museum and the London Library, may
co-exist with a profound ignorance of all that is
really worth knowing. It sounds very intellectual
to theorize about the authorship of the Fourth
Gospel, and to scoff at St. John's "senile iterations
and contorted metaphysics"; but, when a
clergyman read St. Paul's eulogy on Charity instead
of the address at the end of a wedding,
one of his hearers said, "How very appropriate
that was! Where did you get it from?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>We can all patter about the traces of Bacon's
influence in "The Merry Wives of Windsor," and
ransack our family histories for the original of
"Mr. W. H." But, when "Cymbeline" was put
on the stage, society was startled to find that
the title-rôle was not a woman's. A year or two
ago some excellent scenes from Jane Austen's
novels were given in a Belgravian drawing-room,
and a lady of the highest notoriety, enthusiastically
praising the performance, enquired who was
the author of the dialogue between Mr. and
Mrs. John Dashwood, and whether he had written
anything else.</p>

<p>I have known in these later years a judge who
had never seen the view from Richmond Hill;
a publicist who had never heard of Lord Althorp;
and an authoress who did not know the name
of Izaak Walton. But probably the most typical
illustration of modern culture was the reply of a
lady who had been enthusing over the Wagnerian
Cycle, and, when I asked her to tell me quite
honestly, as between old friends, if she really
enjoyed it, replied, "Oh yes! I think one likes
Wagner&mdash;<i>doesn't one</i>?"</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">LI</h2>

<p class="pch">RELIGION</p>

<p>There once was an Evangelical lady who had
a Latitudinarian daughter and a Ritualistic son.
On Sunday morning, when they were forsaking
the family pew and setting out for their respective
places of objectionable worship, these graceless
young people used to join hands and exclaim,
"Look at us, dear mamma! Do we not exemplify
what you are so fond of saying, 'Infidelity
and superstition, those kindred evils, go hand in
hand'?"</p>

<p>The combination thus flippantly stated is a
conspicuous sign of the present times. The decay
of religion and the increase of superstition are
among the most noteworthy of the social changes
which I have seen.</p>

<p>When I speak of the decay of religion, of
course I must be understood to refer only to
external observances. As to interior convictions,
I have neither the will nor the power to investigate
them. I deal only with the habits of religious
practice, and in this respect the contrast between
Then and Now is marked indeed.</p>

<p>In the first place, grace was then said before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
and after dinner. I do not know that the ceremony
was very edifying, but it was traditional
and respectable. Bishop Wilberforce, in his
diary, tells of a greedy clergyman who, when
asked to say grace at a dinner-party, used to vary
the form according to the character of the wine-glasses
which he saw before him on the table.
If they were champagne-glasses, he used to begin
the benediction with "Bountiful Jehovah"; but, if
they were only claret-glasses, he said, "We are
not worthy of the least of Thy mercies."</p>

<p>Charles Kingsley, who generally drew his social
portraits from actual life, described the impressive
eloquence of the Rev. Mr. O'Blareaway, who inaugurated
an exceptionally good dinner by praying
"that the daily bread of our less-favoured brethren
might be mercifully vouchsafed to them."</p>

<p>There was a well-remembered squire in Hertfordshire
whose love of his dinner was constantly
at war with his pietistic traditions. He always
had his glass of sherry poured out before he sat
down to dinner, so that he might get it without
a moment's delay. One night, in his generous
eagerness, he upset the glass just as he dropped
into his seat at the end of grace, and the formula
ran on to an unexpected conclusion, thus: "For
what we are going to receive the Lord make us
truly thankful&mdash;D&mdash;&mdash; n!"</p>

<p>But, if the incongruities which attended grace
before dinner were disturbing, still more so were
the solemnities of the close. Grace after dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
always happened at the moment of loudest and
most general conversation. For an hour and a
half people had been stuffing as if their lives
depended on it&mdash;"one feeding like forty." After
a good deal of sherry, the champagne had made
its tardy appearance, had performed its welcome
rounds, and had in turn been succeeded by port
and home-brewed beer. Out of the abundance
of the mouth the heart speaketh, and every one
was talking at once, and very loud. Perhaps the
venue was laid in a fox-hunting country, and
then the air was full of such voices as these:
"Were you out with the squire to-day?" "Any
sport?" "Yes, we'd rather a nice gallop."
"Plenty of the animal about, I hope?" "Well,
I don't know. I believe that new keeper at Boreham
Wood is a vulpicide. I don't half like his
looks." "What an infernal villain! A man who
would shoot a fox would poison his own grandmother."
"Sh! Sh!" "What's the matter?"
"<i>For what we have received</i>," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Or perhaps we are dining in London in the
height of the season. Fox-hunting is not the
theme, but the conversation is loud, animated,
and discursive. A lyrical echo from the summer
of 1866 is borne back upon my memory&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Agreeable Rattle.</i></p>

<p class="pin4 p1">
This news from abroad is alarming;<br />
You've seen the <i>Pall Mall</i> of to-day!</p>
<p class="pin4">Oh! Ilma di Murska was charming<br />
To-night in the <i>Flauto</i>, they say.</p>

<p class="pin4 p1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>Not a ghost of a chance for the Tories,<br />
In spite of Adullam and Lowe;</p>
<p class="pin4">By the bye, have you heard the queer stories<br />
Of Overend, Gurney and Co.?</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Lively Young Lady.</i> Do you know you've been
talking at the top of your voice all the time grace
was going on?</p>

<p><i>Agreeable Rattle.</i> Not really? I'm awfully sorry.
But our host mumbles so, I never can make out
what he's saying.</p>

<p><i>Lively Young Lady.</i> I can't imagine why people
don't have grace after dessert. I know I'm much
more thankful for strawberry ice than for saddle
of mutton.</p>

<p>And so on and so forth. On the whole, I am
not sure that the abolition of grace is a sign of
moral degeneracy, but I note it as a social change
which I have seen.</p>

<p>Another such change is the disuse of Family
Players. In the days of my youth, morning
prayers at least formed part of the ritual of every
well-ordered household. The scene recurs vividly
to the mental eye&mdash;the dining-room arranged for
breakfast, and the master of the house in top-boots
and breeches with the family Bible in close proximity
to the urn on the table. Mamma very often
breakfasted upstairs; but the sons and daughters of
the house, perhaps with their toilettes not quite
complete, came in with a rush just as the proceedings
began, and a long row of maid-servants,
headed by the housekeeper and supported by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
footmen, were ranged with military precision
against the opposite wall. In families of a more
pronouncedly religious tone, evening prayers were
frequently superadded; and at ten o'clock the
assembled guests were aroused from "Squails"
or "Consequences" by the entrance of the butler
with "Thornton's Family Prayers" on a silver salver.
In one very Evangelical house which I knew in
my youth, printed prayers were superseded by extempore
devotions, and, as the experiment seemed
successful, the servants were invited to make their
contributions in their own words. As long as
only the butler and the housekeeper voiced the
aspirations of their fellows, all was well; but, in an
evil moment, a recalcitrant kitchenmaid uttered
an unlooked-for petition for her master and
mistress&mdash;"And we pray for Sir Thomas and
her Ladyship. Oh! may they have now hearts
given them." And the bare suggestion that there
was room for such an improvement caused a
prompt return to the lively oracles of Henry
Thornton.</p>

<p>I note the disappearance of the domestic liturgy;
and here again, as in the matter of grace, I submit
that, unless the rite can be decently, reasonably,
and reverently performed, it is more honoured
in the breach than in the observance.</p>

<p>Much more significant is the secularization of
Sunday. This is not merely a change, but a
change conspicuously for the worse. The amount
of church-going always differed in different circles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
religious people went often and careless people
went seldom, but almost every one went sometimes,
if merely from a sense of duty and decorum.
Mr. Gladstone, whose traditions were
Evangelical, thought very poorly of what he called
a "once-er," <i>i.e.</i> a person who attended divine
service only once on a Sunday. He himself was
always a "twice-er," and often a "thrice-er"; but
to-day it would puzzle the social critic to discover
a "twice-er," and even a "once-er" is sufficiently
rare to be noticeable.</p>

<p>But far more serious than the decay of mere
attendance at church is the complete abolition of
the Day of Rest. People, who have nothing to
do but to amuse themselves, work at that entrancing
occupation with redoubled energy on
Sundays. If they are in London, they whirl off
to spend the "week-end" amid the meretricious
splendours of the stockbroker's suburban paradise;
and, if they are entertaining friends at their
country houses, they play bridge or tennis or
croquet; they row, ride, cycle, and drive, spend
the afternoon in a punt, and wind up the evening
with "The Washington Post."</p>

<p>All this is an enormous change since the days
when the only decorous amusement for Sunday
was a visit after church to the stables, or a walk
in the afternoon to the home farm or the kitchen
garden; and, of course, it entails a corresponding
amount of labour for the servants. Maids
and valets spend the "week-end" in a whirl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
packing and unpacking, and the whole staff of
the kitchen is continuously employed.</p>

<p>In old days people used to reduce the meals
on Sunday to the narrowest dimensions, in order
to give the servants their weekly due of rest and
recreation, and in a family with which I am
connected the traditional bill of fare for Sunday's
dinner, drawn by a cook who lived before the
School Board, is still affectionately remembered&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">Soup.</p>

<p class="pc">Cold Beef.</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pc">Salad.</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pc"><i>Cold Sweats.</i></p>

<p class="p1">In brief, respectable people used to eat and
drink sparingly on Sunday, caused no unnecessary
work, went a good deal to church, and filled up
their leisure time by visiting sick people in the
cottages or teaching in the Sunday School. No
doubt there was a trace of Puritan strictness
about the former practice, and people too generally
forgot that the First Day of the week is by
Christian tradition a feast. Society has rediscovered
that great truth. It observes the weekly
feast by over-eating itself, and honours the day
of rest by over-working its dependants.</p>

<h2 class="p4">LII</h2>

<p class="pch">SUPERSTITION</p>

<p>"Superstition and infidelity usually go together.
Professed atheists have trafficked in augury, and
men who do not believe in God will believe in
ghosts." To-day I take up my parable concerning
superstition, to which, time out of mind, the
human spirit has betaken itself as soon as it parted
company with faith.</p>

<p>I once asked a lady who, in her earlier life, had
lived in the very heart of society, and who returned
to it after a long absence, what was the change
which struck her most forcibly. She promptly
replied, "The growth of superstition. I hear
people seriously discussing ghosts. In my day
people who talked in that way would have been
put in Bedlam; their relations would have required
no other proof that they were mad."</p>

<p>My own experience entirely confirms this testimony
as to the development of superstition, and
I have had some peculiarly favourable opportunities
of observing its moral effect upon its
votaries. The only superstition tolerated in my
youth was table-turning, and that was always
treated as more than half a joke. To sit in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
darkened room round a tea-table, secretly join
hands under the mahogany, and "communicate
a revolving motion" to it (as Mr. Pickwick to
his fists) was not bad fun when the company was
mainly young and larky, but contained one or two
serious people who desired to probe the mystery
to its depths. Or, perhaps, our psychic force
would cause the respectable piece of furniture
to rear itself upon one leg, and deal out with
a ponderous foot mysterious raps, which the
serious people interpreted with their own admirable
solemnity. I well remember a massive gentleman
with an appalling stammer who proclaimed
that some lost document which we had asked the
table to discover would be found in the Vatican
Library, "wrapped in a ragged palimpsest of
Tertullian;" and the quaintness of the utterance
dissolved the tables, or at least the table-turners,
in laughter. This particular form of superstition
became discredited among respectable people when
sharpers got hold of it and used it as an engine
for robbing the weak-minded. It died, poor thing,
of exposure, and its epitaph was written by Browning
in "Mr. Sludge, the Medium."</p>

<p>It was the same with ghost-stories. People
told them&mdash;partly to fill gaps when reasonable
conversation failed, and partly for the fun of
making credulous hearers stare and gasp. But
no one, except ladies as weak-minded as Byng's
Half-Aunt in "Happy Thoughts," ever thought of
taking them seriously. Bishop Wilberforce invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
a splendid story about a priest and a
sliding panel and a concealed confession; and I
believe that he habitually used it as a foolometer,
to test the mental capacity of new acquaintances.
But the Bishop belonged to that older generation
which despised superstition, and during the last
few years, twaddle of this kind has risen to the
dignity of a pseudo-science.</p>

<p>Necromancy is a favourite substitute for religion.
It supplies the element of mystery without
which the human spirit cannot long subsist;
and, as it does not require its adherents to practise
self-denial, or get up early on Sunday, or
subscribe to charities, or spend their leisure in
evil-smelling slums, it is a cult particularly well
adapted to a self-indulgent age. I vividly remember
a scene which occurred just before the
Coronation. A luxurious luncheon had been prolonged
by the aid of coffee, kümmel, and cigarettes
till four o'clock; and the necromancers&mdash;surfeited,
flushed, and a little maudlin&mdash;were lolling round
the drawing-room fire. A whispered colloquy in a
corner was heard through the surrounding chatter,
and the hostess saw her opportunity. "Dear
Lady De Spook, do let us hear. I know you are
such a wonderful medium."</p>

<p><i>Lady De Spook.</i> Really, it was nothing at all
out of the common. I had come home dead tired
from the opera, and just as I was going to bed I
heard that rap&mdash;you know what I mean?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sludge</i> (enthusiastically). Oh yes, indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
I do! No one who has ever heard it can ever
forget it.</p>

<p><i>Lady De Spook</i> (resuming). Well, and do you
know it turned out to be poor dear Lord De
Spook. It was wonderful how energetically he
rapped, for you know he was quite paralysed
years before he died; and the curious thing was
that I couldn't make out what he said. It seemed
to be, "Don't buy. Sarah. Search." I was too
tired to go on talking to him, so I went to bed;
but next day, do you know, my maid found the
coronet which his first wife, whose name was
Sarah, had worn at the last Coronation. I was
just going to order a new one. Wasn't it a
wonderful interposition!&mdash;Such a saving!</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i> (sentimentally). Ah, wonderful indeed!
Our dear ones are never really lost to us.</p>

<p>Closely connected with necromancy is clairvoyance.
A man whom I knew well was taken
suddenly and seriously ill, and his relations, who
were enthusiastic spookists, telegraphed for the
celebrated clairvoyante Mrs. Endor. She duly
arrived, threw herself into a trance, declared that
the patient would die, came to, and declared that
there was nothing much the matter, and that he
would be about again in two or three days.
Then, having pocketed her cheque, she returned
to London. The patient grew rapidly worse, and
died; and his relations, though I am sure they
sincerely mourned him, were much sustained in
the hour of bereavement by the thought that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
opinion which Mrs. Endor had given in her trance
had proved to be the right one, and that spiritual
science was justified by the result.</p>

<p>But, after all, necromancy and clairvoyance
are a little old-fashioned. Crystal-gazing is more
modish. 'Tis as easy as lying. You gather open-mouthed
round a glass ball, and the gifted gazer
reports that which he or she can see, but which
is invisible to grosser eyes. There are no bounds
to the fascinating range of a crystal-gazer's fancy,
nor to the awestruck credulity with which his
revelations are received.</p>

<p>But crystal is not the only medium through
which a purged eye can discern the mysterious
future. Coffee-grounds, though less romantic,
are very serviceable. Our hostess is an expert
in this form of science, and, being a thoroughly
amiable woman, she makes the coffee say pretty
much what we should like to hear. "Dear Mr.
Taper, this is delightful. You will be Prime
Minister before you die. It is true that your
party will not be in office again just yet; but
'hope on, hope ever,' and trust your star."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Garbage, I have such good news
for you. Your next book will be an immense
success, and, after that, Messrs. Skin &amp; Flint will
be more liberal, and, what with the American
copyright and the acting rights, you will make
quite a fortune."</p>

<p>Closely akin to the science of coffee-grounds
is that of palmistry. A wretched gipsy who "tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
fortunes" at a race-meeting is sent to prison;
but, when St. Berengaria's gets up a bazaar for
its new vestry, a bejewelled lady sits in a secret
chamber (for admission to which an extra half-crown
is charged), and, after scrutinizing your
line of life, tells you that you have had the influenza;
and, projecting her soul into futurity,
predicts that the next time you have it you will
get pneumonia unless you are very careful.</p>

<p>Of course, these minor superstitions are mainly
ridiculous, and to get up moral indignation over
them would be a waste of force. But one cannot
speak so lightly of the degrading cults which
are grouped together under the name of Spiritualism.
I have known a "Spiritual Wife" who was
highly commended in spookish circles because
she left her husband, family, and home in one
continent and crossed the world to find her
"affinity" in another. I have known a most
promising boy whose health was destroyed and
his career ruined by a hypnotic experiment performed
on him without his parents' knowledge.
I have known a mesmeric clergyman who cozened
the women of his congregation out of money,
character, and in some cases reason. Where
occultism is pursued, all veracity and self-respect
disappear; pruriency finds a congenial lodgment,
and the issue is&mdash;well&mdash;what we sometimes see
exhibited in all its uncomeliness at the Central
Criminal Court.</p>

<p>The wisest lawgiver who ever lived said, "Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
shalt not suffer a witch to live." And a great
judge acted on the rule. But that was a long
time ago. We have improved upon the jurisprudence
of Moses and the methods of Sir Matthew
Hale. Stoning and hanging are a little out of
date, but boycotting is a remedy still within our
reach. Whoso is wise will ponder these things,
and will give occultists, male and female, an uncommonly
wide berth.</p>

<h2 class="p4">LIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE REMNANT</p>

<p>Some recent observations of mine on the deterioration
of society have drawn this interesting
response from an eminent clergyman in the
north of London:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it possible that in 'Society' itself there is a
point of resistance which may be touched by an
effective appeal coming from the wholesomer
elements in English life? Belonging as I do
to that section of English life which is a stranger
to Society in the technical sense, I am deeply
impressed with the taint which comes to all
circles of society from the contamination of the
circle at the top. To elicit a strong opinion and
a resolute determination from what I may call
the Puritan side of English life, may be perhaps
the first step towards the correction of the evil
which Mr. Russell describes. Are there not in
Society itself some men and women who retain
the high ideals and the strenuous purposes of
their ancestry? Can they be induced to raise
their protest, to assert their principles, and open
the way to a better&mdash;because a purer&mdash;future?
I venture to make this appeal because it is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
fixed conviction that even in the worst and most
degraded society there are men who sigh for
better things, just as in the worst and most degraded
men there remains a desire, however overlaid,
for regeneration."</p>

<p>Well, frankly I think that an amiable insanity
deludes my reverend friend if he expects a moral
reformation in the sort of society which I have
been describing. It would tax the combined
energies of St. John the Baptist, Savonarola, the
two Wesleys, and George Whitefield, all rolled
into one, to convince the people whom I have
in my mind of their ethical shortcomings. They
have made their own beds, in every sense of
that expressive phrase, and must lie on them till
the cataclysm comes which will bring us all to
our senses.</p>

<p>But I am reminded that I promised to write
not exclusively about deteriorations in society,
but about changes of all kinds. That there
has been some change for the better I readily
admit, as well as an enormous number of changes
for the worse. "All things are double," says the
Son of Sirach, "one against the other," and in
this closing chapter I will try to balance our gains
and our losses.</p>

<p>That there has always been a mixture of good
and bad in society is only another way of saying
that society is part of mankind; but, if I am
right in my survey, the bad just now is flagrant
and ostentatious to a degree which we have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
known in England since 1837. There was once
a moralist who spoke of the narrow path which
lay between right and wrong, and similarly there
used to be a Debatable Land which lay between
the good and evil districts of society. It was
inhabited by the people who, having no ethical
convictions of their own, go very much as they
are led. It was written of them long ago that&mdash;</p>

<p class="piq4 p1">"They eat, they drink, they sleep, they plod,<br />
They go to church on Sunday;</p>
<p class="pin4">And many are afraid of God,<br />
And more of Mrs. Grundy."</p>

<p class="p1">As long as Mrs. Grundy was a real, though
comical, guardian of social propriety&mdash;as long
as the highest influences in the social system
tended towards virtue and decorum&mdash;the inhabitants
of the Debatable Land were even painfully
respectable. But now that the "trend" (as
Pennialinus calls it) is all the other way, and
Mrs. Grundy has been deposed as a bore and
an anachronism, they willingly follow the "smart"
multitude to do evil; and so the area covered
by social wickedness is much larger than in
former times. In other words, the evil of society
is both worse in quality and larger in quantity
than it was fifty&mdash;or even twenty&mdash;years ago.</p>

<p>Now if this be true&mdash;and I hold it to be unquestionable&mdash;what
have we to set against it? I
reply, the greatly increased activity of those who
are really good. In old days the good were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
good in a quiescent and lethargic way. They
were punctual in religious observances, public
and private; exemplary in the home and the
family, and generous to the poor. But their
religion could scarcely be called active, except
in so far as pottering about among the cottages,
or teaching a class of well-washed children in
the Sunday School, can be reckoned as active
employments; and even such activities as these
were as a rule confined to women.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott believed that "there were
few young men, and those very sturdy moralists,
who would not rather be taxed with some moral
peccadillo than with want of horsemanship."
And, in days much more recent than the beloved
Sir Walter's, men, if they were religious,
studiously kept their light under a bushel, and
took the utmost pains to avoid being detected in
acts of charity or devotion.</p>

<p>Nowadays all this is changed, and changed, in
my opinion, much for the better. Religious
people are ready to let the world know what
they believe, and are active in the pursuit of
the things which are pure and lovely and of
good report. Well-dressed young men combine
dancing with slumming. Untidiness and dulness
are no longer the necessary concomitants of
virtue. Officers of the Guards sing in the choir
and serve the altar. Men whose names are
written in the book of the peerage as well as
the Book of Life conduct Bible-classes and hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
round the hymn-books at mission-services. The
group of young M.P.'s who were nicknamed
"Hughligans" showed the astonished House of
Commons that Religion is as practical a thing
as Politics, and (as one of them lately said) they
cheerfully encountered that hot water which is
the modern substitute for boiling oil. The Universities
send their best athletes and social
favourites to curacies in the slums or martyrdom
in the mission-field. The example set by Mr.
James Adderley, when he left Christ Church and
founded the Oxford House at Bethnal Green,
has been followed in every direction. Both the
Universities, and most of the colleges, run "Settlements,"
where laymen, in the intervals of professional
work and social enjoyment, spread religion,
culture, and physical education amid the "dim,
common populations" of Camberwell and Stratford
and Poplar.</p>

<p>The Public Schools, formerly denounced as
"the seats and nurseries of vice," make their full
contribution to active religion. Eton and Winchester
and Harrow have their Missions in
crowded quarters of great towns. At one school,
the boys have a guild of devotion; at another, a
voluntary Bible-class with which no master inter-meddles.
And so the young citizens of the
privileged order gain their first lessons in religious
and social service, and carry the idea with them
to the Army or the Bar or the Stock Exchange
or the House of Commons. All this is, in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
eyes, a social change which is also a clear and
enormous gain.</p>

<p>But, if what I say is true of men, it is even
more conspicuously true of women. They are
no longer content with the moderate church-going
at comfortable hours, and the periodical
visits to particularly clean cottages, which at one
time were the sum-total of their activities. Every
well-organized parish has its staff of woman-workers,
who combine method with enthusiasm
and piety with common sense. Belgravia and
Mayfair send armies of district-visitors to Hoxton
and Poplar. Girls from fashionable homes, pretty
and well dressed, sacrifice their evenings to clubs
and social gatherings for factory-hands and maids-of-all-work.
Beneath the glittering surface of
social life, there is a deep current of wise and
devoted effort for those unhappy beings who are
least able to help themselves. And all this philanthropic
energy is distinctively and avowedly Christian.
It is the work of men and women, young
and old, widely differentiated from one another in
outward circumstances of wealth and accomplishments
and social influence, but all agreed about
"the one thing needful," and all keen to confess
their faith before a hostile world.</p>

<p>What, then, is the conclusion of the whole
matter? Society, during the years in which I
have known it, has changed enormously, alike
in its exterior characteristics and, as far as I can
judge, in its inner spirit. While some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
changes have been simply innocuous, and a few
even beneficial, the great majority have been
gross and palpable deteriorations. An onlooker
who knew society well thus described its present
condition: "We are living in an age of decadence,
and we pretend not to know it. There is not a
feature wanting, though we cannot mention the
worst of them. We are Romans of the worst
period, given up to luxury and effeminacy, and
caring for nothing but money. We care no more
for beauty in art, but only for a brutal realism.
Sport has lost its manliness, and is a matter of
pigeons from a trap, or a mountain of crushed
pheasants to sell to your own tradesmen. Religion
is coming down to jugglers and table-turnings
and philanderings with cults brought, like the
rites of Isis, from the East; and as for patriotism,
it is turned on like beer at election times, or
worked like a mechanical doll by wire-pullers.
We belong to one of the most corrupt generations
of the human race. To find its equal one
must go back to the worst times of the Roman
Empire, and look devilish close then. But it's
uncommonly amusing to live in an age of decadence;
you see the funniest sights and you get
every conceivable luxury, and you die before the
irruption of the barbarians."</p>

<p>This is, I believe, a true indictment against the
age in which our lot is cast, although the utterance
has just that touch of exaggeration which secures
a hearing for unpalatable truth. But the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
wrote it left out of account that redeeming element
in our national life which I have discussed in this
closing chapter. After all, there is a world-wide
difference between the "Majority" and the "Remnant,"&mdash;and
the ten righteous men may yet save
the guilty city.</p>
